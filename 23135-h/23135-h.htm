<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In ancient Egypt the performance of circumcision was at one time limited
to the priesthood, who, in addition to the cleanliness that this
operation imparted to that class, added the shaving of the whole body as
a means of further purification. The nobility, royalty, and the higher
warrior class seem to have adopted circumcision as well, either as a
hygienic precaution or as an aristocratic prerogative and insignia.
Among the Greeks we find a like practice, and we are told that in the
times of Pythagoras the Greek philosophers were also circumcised,
although we find no mention that the operation went beyond the
intellectual class. In the United States, France, and in England, there
is a class which also observe circumcision as a hygienic precaution,
where, from my personal observation, I have found that circumcision is
thoroughly practiced in every male member of many of the families of the
class,&mdash;this being the physician class. In general conversation with
physicians on this subject, it has really been surprising to see the
large number who have had themselves circumcised, either through the
advice of some college professor while attending lectures or as a result
of their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>own subsequent convictions when engaged in actual practice and
daily coming in contact both with the benefits that are to be derived in
the way of a better physical, mental, and moral health, as well as with
the many dangers and disadvantages that follow the uncircumcised,&mdash;the
latter being probably the most frequent incentive and determinator,&mdash;as
in many of these latter examples the operation of circumcision, with its
pains, annoyances, and possible and probable dangers, sink into the most
trifling insignificance in comparison to some of the results that are
daily observed as the tribute that is paid by the unlucky and unhappy
wearer of a prepuce for the privilege of possessing such an appendage.</p>

<p>There is one thing that must be admitted concerning circumcision: this
being that, among medical men or men of ordinary intelligence who have
had the operation performed, instead of being dissatisfied, they have
extended the advantages they have themselves received, by having those
in their charge likewise operated upon. The practice is now much more
prevalent than is supposed, as there are many Christian families where
males are regularly circumcised soon after birth, who simply do so as a
hygienic measure.</p>

<p>For the benefit of these, who may congratulate themselves upon the
dangers and annoyances that they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>and their families have escaped, and
for the benefit of those who would run into these dangers but for timely
warning, this book has been especially written. To my professional
brothers the book will prove a source of instruction and recreation,
for, while it contains a lot of pathology regarding the moral and
physical reasons why circumcision should be performed, which might be as
undigestible as a mess of Boston brown bread and beans on a French
stomach, I have endeavored to make that part of the book readable and
interesting. The operative chapter will be particularly useful and
interesting to physicians, as I have there given a careful and impartial
review of all the operative procedures,&mdash;from the most simple to the
most elaborate,&mdash;besides paying more than particular attention to the
subject of after-dressings. The part that relates to the natural history
of man will interest all manner of people. I regret that the tabular
statistics are not to be had, but in this regard we must use our best
judgment from the material we have on hand; at any rate, I have tried to
furnish a sufficiency of facts, so that, unless the reader is too
overexacting, he will not find much difficulty in arriving at a
conclusion on the subject.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>This book is the amplification of a paper, the subject of which was,
&ldquo;A Plea for Circumcision; or, the Dangers that Arise from the
Prepuce,&rdquo; which was read at the meeting of the Southern California
Medical Society, at Pasadena, in December, 1889. The material gathered
for that paper was more than could be used in the ordinary limits of a
society paper; it was gathered and ready for use, and this suggested its
arrangement into book form. The subject of the paper was itself
suggested by a long and personal observation of the changes made in man
by circumcision. From the individual observation of cases, it was but
natural to wish to enlarge the scope of our observation and comparison;
this naturally led to a study of the physical characteristics of the
only race that could practically be used for the purpose. This race is
the Jewish race. On carefully studying into the subject, I plainly saw
that much of their longevity could consistently be ascribed to their
more practical humanitarianism, in caring for their poor, their sick, as
well as in their generous provision for their unfortunate aged people.
The social fabric of the Jewish family is also more calculated to
promote long life, as, strangely as it may seem, family veneration and
family love and attachment are far more strong and practical among this
people than among Christians, this sentiment not being even as strong in
the Christian races as it is in the Chinese or Japanese. It certainly
forms as much of a part of the teachings of Christianity as it does of
Judaism, Buddhism, or Confucianism, only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Christians, as a mass, have practically forgotten it. The occupation
followed by the Jews also in a certain degree favors longevity, and the
influence on heredity induced by all these combined conditions goes for
something. But it is not alone in the matter of simple
longevity&mdash;although that implies considerable&mdash;that the Jewish
race is found to be better situated. Actual observations show them to be
exempt from many diseases which affect other races; so that it is not
only that they recover more promptly, but that they are not, as a class,
subjected to the loss of time by illness, or to the consequent
sufferings due to illness or disease, in anything like or like ratio
with other people.</p>

<p>There is also a less tendency to criminality, debauchery, and
intemperance in the race; this, again, can in a measure be ascribed to
their family influence, which even in our day has not lost that
patriarchal influence which tinges the home or family life in the Old
Testament. Crimes against the person or property committed by Jews are
rare. They likewise do not figure in either police courts or
penitentiary records; they are not inmates of our poor-houses, but, what
is also singular, they are never accused of many silly crimes, such as
indecent exposures, assaults on young girls; nor do they figure in any
such exposures as the one recently made by the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>After allowing all that, which we can, in its fullest limit, to
religion, family, or social habit, there is still a wide margin to be
accounted for. This has naturally let the inquiry, followed in the
course of this book, into a careful review of the Jewish people; into
their religion and its character, its relation to other creeds, and to
the world&rsquo;s history; into their many wanderings, and into the
dispersion, and we have even been obliged to follow <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
them into the midst of the people among whom they have become nationed,
to try, if possible, to find the cause of this racial difference in
health, resistance to disease, decay, and death. It has been necessary,
in following out the research, to give a condensed
<i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the religious, political, and social condition
of the Jewish commonwealth, which, although in a state of dispersion,
still exists. I need offer no apology for the extended notice this has
received in the course of the book. We read with increasing interest
either Hallam or May, Buckle or Guizot, through the spasmodic, halting,
retrograding, advancing, erratic, aimless, and accidental phases that
England has plowed through, from the days of goutless, simple, and
chaste, but barbarian England of the Saxons, to the present civilized,
enlightened, gouty, &ldquo;Darkest England&rdquo; of General Booth; and,
after all is said and done, we are no wiser in any practical resulting
good. We simply know that the English people, so to speak, have, as it
were, gone through the figures of some social aspects, as if dancing the
&ldquo;Lancers,&rdquo; with its forward and back movements, gallop,
etc., and have finally sat down, better dressed and better housed, but
in an acquired state of moral and physical degeneration. The Briton of
Queen Victoria is not the Briton of Queen Boadicea, either morally or
physically. On the other hand, the system of sociological tables adopted
by Herbert Spencer would have but little to record for some six thousand
years&mdash;either in religion, morals, or physique&mdash;as making any
changes in the history of that simple people which, in the mountainous
regions of Ur, in distant Armenia, started on its pilgrimage of life and
racial existence; in one branch of the family&mdash;that of
Ishmael&mdash;the changes to be recorded are so invisible that its
descendants may really be said <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to live to-day as they lived then. So that I do not feel that I need to
apologize for the space I have given to this subject in the course of
the book. The causes that make these racial distinctions should be of
interest alike to the moralist, theologist, sociologist, and to the
physician.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical writers and moralists, as well as writers of fiction or
dramatizers, can write on anything they please, and it is eagerly taken
up and read by the people generally, either of high or low degree,
alike; and somehow these people seem never to require an apology on the
part of the author, for having attempted rapes, seductions, or even
unavoidable fornication committed through the leaves of the story, or
having it imaginably take place between acts on the stage. But if the
physician writes a book touching anything connected with the generative
functions, and with the best intent and for the good of humanity, he is
expected to make some prefatory apology. He is supposed to address a
public who all of a sudden have become intensely moral and extremely
sensitive in their modesty. Why things are thus I cannot explain. They
are so, nevertheless. From the time that the celebrated Astruc wrote his
treatise on female diseases, near the end of the seventeenth
century,&mdash;who felt compelled by the extreme modesty of the people in
this particular&mdash;but who, outside of medicine, were about as virtuous as
the average Tabby or Tom cats in the midnight hour&mdash;to write the chapter
touching on nymphomania in Latin, so as not to shock the morbidly
sensitive modesty of the French nobility, who then enjoyed <i>Le Droit de
cuissage</i>,&mdash;down through to Bienville, who wrote the first extended work
on nymphomania, and Tissot, who first broached the subject and the
danger of Onanism, all have felt that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
they must stop on the threshold and &ldquo;apologize.&rdquo; Tissot,
however, seemed to possess a robust and a plain Hippocratic mind, and as
he apologized he could not help but see the ridiculousness of so doing,
as in the preface to his work we find the following: &ldquo;Shall we
remain silent on so important a subject? By no means. The sacred
authors, the Fathers of the Church, who present their thoughts in living
words, and ecclesiastical authors have not felt that silence was best. I
have followed their example, and shall exclaim, with St. Augustine,
&lsquo;If what I have written scandalizes any prudish persons, let them
rather accuse the turpitude of their own thoughts than the words I have
been obliged to use.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>For my part, I think that people who can go to the theatre and enjoy
&ldquo;As in a Looking-Glass,&rdquo; and witness some of the satyrical
or billy-goat traits of humanity so graphically exhibited in &ldquo;La
Tosca,&rdquo; with evident satisfaction; or attend the more robust plays
of &ldquo;Virginius&rdquo; or of &ldquo;Galba, the Gladiator,&rdquo;
with all its suggestions of the C&aelig;sarian section, and the lust and the
fornications of an intensely animal Roman empress, without the
destruction of their moral equilibrium or tending to induce in them a
disposition to commit a rape on the first met,&mdash;I think such people can
be safely intrusted to read this book.</p>

<p>And as to the reading public, there are but few general readers who
could honestly plead an ignorance of the &ldquo;Decameron,&rdquo;
Balzac, La Fontaine, &ldquo;Heptameron,&rdquo; Cr&eacute;billon <i>fils</i>, or of
matter-of-fact Monsieur le Docteur Maitre Rabelais,&mdash;works which, more
or less, carry a moral instruction in every tale, which, like the tales
of the &ldquo;Malice of Women,&rdquo; in the unexpurged edition of the
literal translation of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; contains much
more of practical moral lessons, even if in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
flowery and warm, spiced language of the Orient, than any supposed
nastiness, on account of which they are classed among the prohibited. To
these, and the readers of Amelie Rives&rsquo;s books, or other intensely
realistic literature, I need not imitate the warning of Ansonius, who
warned his readers on the threshold of a part of his book to &ldquo;stop
and consider well their strength before proceeding with its
lecture.&rdquo; Metaphorically speaking, the general theatre-going, or
modern literature-reading public, can be considered pretty callous and
morally bullet proof. I shall therefore make no apology.</p>

<p>Some fault may, perhaps, be found with some of the occasional style of
the book, or with some of the subjects used to illustrate a principle.
To the extremely wise, good, and scientific, these illustrations were
unnecessary; this need hardly be mentioned; and the passages which to
some may prove objectionable were not intended for them, either with the
expectation of delighting them or with the purpose of shocking them.
These passages, they can easily avoid. This book, however, was written
that it might be read: not only read by the Solon, Socrates, Plato, or
Seneca of the laity or the profession, but even by the billy-goated
dispositioned, vulgar plebeian, who could no more be made to read cold,
scientific, ungarnished facts than you can make an unwilling horse drink
at the watering-trough. Human weakness and perversity is silly, but it
is sillier to ignore that it exists. So, for the sake of boring and
driving a few solid facts into the otherwise undigesting and unthinking,
as well as primarily obdurate understanding of the untutored plebeian, I
ask the indulgence of the intelligent and broad-minded as well as the
easily inducted reader. Cleopatra was smuggled into C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
presence in a roll of tapestry; the Greeks introduced <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
their men into Troy by means of a wooden horse; and the discoverer of
the broad Pacific Ocean made his escape from his importunate creditors
disguised as a cask of merchandise. So, when we wish to accomplish an
object, we must adopt appropriate means, even if they may apparently
seem to have an entirely diametrically opposite object. The Athenian,
Themistocles, when wishing to make the battle of Salamis decisive, was
inspired with the idea of sending word to the Persian monarch that the
Greeks were trying to escape, advising him to block the passage; this
saved Greece.</p>

<p>There is a weird and ghostly but interesting tale connected with the
Moslem conquest of Spain, of how Roderick, the last of the Gothic kings,
when in trouble and worry, repaired to an old castle, in the secret
recesses of which was a magic table whereon would pass in grim
procession the different events of the future of Spain; as he gazed on
the enchanted table he there saw his own ruin and his country&rsquo;s
and nation&rsquo;s subjugation. Anatomy is generally called a dry study,
but, like the enchanted brazen table in the ancient Gothic castle, it
tells a no less weird or interesting tale of the past. Its revelations
lighten up a long vista, through the thousands of years through which
the human species has evolved from its earliest appearance on earth,
gradually working up through the different evolutionary processes to
what is to-day supposed to be the acme of perfection as seen in the
Indo-European and Semitic races of man. Anatomy points to the
rudiment&mdash;still lingering, now and then still appearing in some one man
and without a trace in the next&mdash;of that climbing muscle which shows man
in the past either nervously escaping up the trunk of a tree in his
flight from many of the carnivorous animals with whom he was
contemporary, or, as the shades <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of night were beginning to gather around him, we again see him by the
aid of these muscles leisurely climbing up to some hospitable fork in
the tree, where the robust habits of the age allowed him to find a
comfortable resting-place; protected from the dew of the night by the
overhanging branches and from the prowling hyena by the height of the
tree, he passed the night in security. The now useless ear-muscles, as
well as the equally useless series of muscles about the nose, also tell
us of a movable, flapping ear capable of being turned in any direction
to catch the sound of approaching danger, as well as of a movable and
dilated nostril that scented danger from afar,&mdash;the olfactory sense
at one time having a different function and more essential to life than
that of merely noting the differential aroma emitted by segars or cups
of Mocha or Java, and the ear being then used for some more useful
purpose than having its tympanum tortured by Wagnerian discordant
sounds. Our ancestors might not have been a very handsome set, nor,
judging from the Neanderthal skull, could they have had a very winning
physiognomy, but they were a very hardy and self-reliant set of men.
Nature&mdash;always careful that nothing should interfere with the
procreative functions&mdash;had provided him with a sheath or prepuce,
wherein he carried his procreative organ safely out of harm&rsquo;s way,
in wild steeple-chases through thorny briars and bramble-brakes, or,
when hardly pushed, and not able to climb quickly a tree of his own
choice, he was by circumstances forced up the sides of some rough-barked
or thorny tree. This leathery pouch also protected him from the many
leeches, small aquatic lizards, or other animals that infested the
marshes or rivers through which he had at times to wade or swim; or
served as a protection from the bites of ants or other <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
vermin when, tired, he rested on his haunches on some mossy bank or
sand-hill.</p>

<p>Man has now no use for any of these necessaries of a long-past age,&mdash;an
age so remote that the speculations of Ernest Renan regarding the
differences between the Semitic race of Shem and the idolatrous
descendants of Ham, away off in the far mountains and valleys of Asia
lying between the Mediterranean Sea and the Euphrates, seem more as if
he were discussing an event of yesterday than something which is
considered contemporary with our earlier history,&mdash;and we find them
disappearing, disuse gradually producing an obliteration of this tissue
in some cases, and the modifying influence of evolution producing it in
others; the climbing muscle, probably the oldest remnant and legacy that
has descended from our long-haired and muscular ancestry, is the best
example of disappearance caused by disuse, while the effectual
disappearance of the prepuce in many cases shows that in that regard
there exists a marked difference in the evolutionary march among
different individuals.</p>

<p>There is a strange and unaccountable condition of things, however,
connected with the prepuce that does not exist with the other vestiges
of our arboreal or sylvan existence. Firstly, the other conditions have
nothing that interferes with their disappearance; whereas the prepuce,
by its mechanical construction and the expanding portions which it
incloses, tends at times rather to its exaggerated development than to
its disappearance. Again, whereas the other vestiges have no injury that
they inflict by their presence, or danger that they cause their
possessors to run, the prepuce is from time of birth a source of
annoyance, danger, suffering, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and death. Then, again, the other conditions are not more developed at
birth; whereas the prepuce seems, in our pre-natal life, to have an
unusual and unseen-for-use existence, being in bulk out of all
proportion to the organ it is intended to cover. Speculation as to its
existence is as unprolific of results as any we may indulge in regarding
the nature, object, or uses of that other evolutionary appendage, the
appendix vermiformis, the recollection of whose existence always adds an
extra flavor to tomatoes, figs, or any other small-seeded fruits.</p>

<p>We may well exclaim, as we behold this appendage to man,&mdash;now of no use
in health and of the most doubtful assistance to the very organ it was
intended to protect, when that organ, through its iniquitous tastes, has
got itself into trouble, and, Job-like, is lying repentant and sick in
its many wrappings of lint, with perhaps its companions in crime
imprisoned in a suspensory bandage,&mdash;what is this prepuce? Whence, why,
where, and whither? At times, Nature, as if impatient of the slow march
of gradual evolution, and exasperated at this persistent and useless as
well as dangerous relic of a far-distant prehistoric age, takes things
in her own hands and induces a sloughing to take place, which rids it of
its annoyance. In the far-off land of Ur, among the mountainous regions
of Kurdistan, something over six thousand years ago, the fathers of the
Hebrew race, inspired by a wisdom that could be nothing less than of
divine origin, forestalled the process of evolution by establishing the
rite of circumcision. Whether this has been beneficial or injurious to
the race will be, in a measure, the object of the discussion in this
book.</p>

<p>One object of this book is to furnish my professional brothers with some
embodied facts that they may use in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
convincing the laity in many cases where they themselves are convinced
that circumcision is absolutely necessary; but, having nothing in their
text-books to back up their opinion with, their explanations are too apt
to pass for their mere unfounded personal view of the matter. If the
patient, or the parents of the patient, ask the physician for his
authority, he is at a loss, as there is nothing that deals with the
subject in any extended manner; so that this book has been written in as
plain English as the subject-matter could possibly allow, so that
non-professionals could easily read and understand it. I have often felt
the need of such a work; people can understand emergency or accident
surgery, military surgery, or reparative surgery, but such a thing as
surgery to remedy a seemingly medical disease, or what might be called
the preventive practice of surgery, is something they cannot understand.
First, and not the least, among the incentives to skepticism on this
subject is the unwelcome fact of a surgical operation, which, no matter
how trivial it may seem to the surgeon, is a matter of considerable
magnitude to the patient, his parents, or friends; there are risks,
pain, worry, annoyances, and expenses to be
undergone,&mdash;considerations which, either singly or unitedly, often
lead one to reason against the operation, even when otherwise convinced
of its need or utility.</p>

<p>The hardest to convince are those, however, who insist on having a
four-and-a-half-foot-gauge fact driven through their two-foot-gated
understanding, without it ever occurring to them that the gate, and not
the fact, is the faulty article, Some of these gentry are very
unconvincible. They at times remind one of that description given by
Carlyle in regard to one of the Georges, who found himself, when Prince
of Wales, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
leading an army in Flanders, and actually engaged in a battle. His
Royal Highness was on foot, and was seen standing facing the enemy, with
outstretched legs, like a Colossus of Rhodes, impassive and
stolid,&mdash;the very impersonification of Dutch courage and
aggressiveness. There he stood, unconscious whether he was at the head
of an army or single attendant; he might be overridden and annihilated,
overturned and expunged, but there he would most assuredly stand and
fall, if need be; overwhelming squadrons, by their impetus and weight,
might ride him down and crush him; but one thing was most certain, this
certain fact being that he never could be made to retreat or advance, as
no impression from front or rear could convince him of the necessity of
either.</p>

<p>Then, there is our statistical friend, who cannot discriminate between
the exception and the rule by any common-sense deductions. He must have
all the authentic, carefully-compiled statistics before he can allow
himself to form any opinion. As long as there is the smallest fraction
of a decimal unaccounted for in a mathematical way, this individual is
inconvincible. These men pride themselves upon being methodically exact;
they express their willingness to be convinced if you can present
acceptable proofs; but, trying to present simple rational proofs to
these individuals is considerably like presenting a meal of boiled pork
and cabbage to a confirmed and hypochondriacal dyspeptic,&mdash;it only
increases their mental dyspepsia.</p>

<p>Had Columbus waited to discover America, or had Galileo waited to
proclaim the motion of the earth, until authorized to a serious
consideration of the matter by properly-tabled statistics, they would
have waited a long, long time; and, it may be added, the inconveniences
that attend the proving of a negative will so <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
interfere with the proper arrangement of statistical matter which
relates to the prepuce and circumcision that, before such tables could
be satisfactorily and convincingly constructed, time and the
evolutionary processes that follow it will bid fair to completely remove
this debatable appendage from man. It may be at a very far-distant
period that this evolutionary preputial extinction will take
place,&mdash;probably contemporary with the existence of Bulwer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Coming Race,&rdquo;&mdash;but not at a too remote period for the
proper and satisfactory tabulation of the statistics.</p>

<p>The ideas of the etiology and pathological processes through which we
journey,&mdash;from a condition of health and good feeling to one of disease,
miserable feeling, and death,&mdash;as described in, or rather as they
control the sentiment and policy of, this work, are such as have been
followed by Hutchinson, Fothergill, Beale, Black, Albutt, and
Richardson, so that if I have totally ignored the old conventional
systems, with their hide-bound classification of diseases to control the
etiology, I have not done so without some reliable authority. In
studying the etiology of diseases we have, as a rule, been content to
accept the disease when fully formed and properly labeled, being
apparently satisfied with beginning our investigation not at the initial
point of departure from health, but at some distant point from this, at
the point where this departure has elaborated itself, on favorable
ground, into a tangible general or local disease. As truthfully observed
by T. Clifford Albutt: &ldquo;The philosophic inquirer is not satisfied
to know that a person is suffering, for example, from a cancer. He
desires to know why he is so suffering,&mdash;that is, what are the processes
which necessarily precede or follow it. He wishes to include this
phenomena, now isolated, in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a series of which it must necessarily be but a member, to trace the
period of which it must be but a phase. He believes that diseased
processes have their evolution and the laws of it, as have other natural
processes, and he believes that these are fixed and knowable.&rdquo; To
do this, the physician must travel beyond the beaten path of etiology as
found in our text-books. He must follow Hutchinson in the train of
reasoning that elucidates the pre-cancerous stage of cancer, or tread in
the path followed by Sir Lionel Beale, in finding that the cause of
disease depends on a blood change and the developmental defect, or the
tendency or inherent weakness of the affected part or organ; to fully
appreciate the inherent etiological factors that reside in man, and
which constitute the tendency to disease or premature decay and death,
we must also be able to follow Canstatt, Day, Rostan, Charcot, Rush,
Cheyne, Humphry, or Reveille-Parise into the study of the different
conditions which, though normal, are nevertheless factors of a slow or a
long life. We must also be able to appreciate fully the value of that
interdependence of each part of our organism, which often, owing to a
want of equilibrium of strength and resistance in some part when
compared to the rest, causes the whole to give way, just as a flaw in a
levee will cause the whole of the solidly-constructed mass to give way,
or a demoralized regiment may entail the utter <ins class='corr'
title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;route&rsquo;.">rout</ins> of an army. As described by George Murray
Humphry, in his instructive work on &ldquo;Old Age,&rdquo; at page
11:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first requisite for longevity must clearly be an inherent or
inborn quality of endurance, of steady, persistent nutritive force,
which includes reparative force and resistance to disturbing agencies,
and a good proportion or balance between the several organs. Each organ
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
must be sound in itself, and its strength must have a due relation to
the strength of the other organs. If the heart and the digestive system
be disproportionately strong, they will overload and oppress the other
organs, one of which will soon give way; and, as the strength of the
human body, like that of a chain, is to be measured by its weaker link,
one disproportionately feeble organ endangers or destroys the whole. The
second requisite is freedom from exposure to the various casualties,
indiscretions, and other causes of disease to which illness and early
death are so much due.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In following out our study of diseases, we have been too closely
narrowed down by the old symptomatic story of disease; we have too much
treated surface symptoms, and neglected to study the man and his
surroundings as a whole; we have overlooked the fact that there exists a
geographical fatalism in a physical sense as well as the existence of
the influence of that climatic fatalism so well described by Alfred
Haviland, and the presence of a fatalism of individual constitution as
well, which is either inherited or acquired. The idea that Charcot
elaborates, that, as the year passes successively through the hot and
the cold, through the dry and the wet season, with advancing age the
human body undergoes like changes, and diseases assume certain
characteristics, are also points that are overlooked; and nowhere is
this latter view seen to be more neglected than in the relations the
prepuce bears to infancy, prime and old age, as will be more fully
explained in the chapters in this book which treat of cancer and
gangrene. Admitting that Haviland has exaggerated the influence of
climate as an etiological factor in its specific influence in producing
certain diseases; or that M. Taine claims more than he should for his
&ldquo;Th&egrave;orie <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
des Milieux,&rdquo; or influence of surroundings; or that Hutchinson
has drawn the hereditary and pedigreeal fatherhood of disease too
finely; it must also be admitted that the solid, tangible truths upon
which these authors have founded their premises are plainly visible to
the most skeptical; the architectural details of the superstructure may
be defective, but the foundation is permanent.</p>

<p>From the above outline it will be easier for the reader to follow out
the reasons, or the whys or wherefores, of the views expressed on
medicine in the course of the book; and, although I do not wish to enter
the medical field like a Peter the Hermit on a new crusade, to lure
thousands into the hands of the circumcisers, nor, as a new Mohammed,
promise the eternal bliss and glory of the seventh heaven to all the
circumcised, I ask of my professional brothers a calm and unprejudiced
perusal of the tangible and authentic facts that I have honestly
gathered and conscientiously commented upon from my field of vision,
which will be plainly presented in the following pages. I simply have
given the facts and my impressions: the reader is at liberty to draw his
own conclusions.</p>

<p>If I have been too tedious in the multiplication of incidents in support
of certain views, I must remind the reader that the verdict goes to him
who has the preponderance of testimony, and that many a lawsuit is lost
from the neglect, on the part of the loser, to secure all the available
testimony. Having brought the subject of circumcision before the bar of
public opinion, as well as that of my professional brother, I would but
illy do justice to the subject at the bar, or to myself, not to properly
present the case; as it was remarked by Napoleon, &ldquo;God is on the
side of the heaviest artillery,&rdquo; and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
he who loses a battle for want of guns should not rail at Providence
if, having them on hand, he has neglected to bring them into action.</p>

<p>The reasons for the existence of the book will become self-evident as
the reader labors through the medical part of the work. Our text-books
are, as a class, even those on diseases of children as a specialty,
singularly and unpardonably silent and deficient on the subject of
either the prepuce and the diseases to which it leads, or circumcision;
and even our surgical works are not sufficiently explicit, as they deal
more with the developed disease and the operative measures for its
removal than on any preventive surgery or medicine. Our works on
medicine are equally silent, and, although from a perusal of the latter
part of the book the prepuce and circumcision will be seen to have
considerable bearing on the production and nature of phthisis, this
subject would, owing to our strabismic way of studying medicine, look
most singularly out of place in a work devoted to diseases of the lungs
or throat. Owing to this poverty of literature on the subject, and that
the library of the average practitioner could therefore not furnish all
the data relating to it that the profession have in their possession, a
book of this nature will furnish them the required material whereupon to
form the basis of an opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>To argue that the prepuce is not such a deadly appendage because so many
escape alive and well who are uncircumcised, would be as logical as to
assume that Lee&rsquo;s chief of artillery neglected to properly place
his guns on the heights back of Fredericksburg. He had asserted, the
night before the battle, that not a chicken could live on the
intervening plateau between the heights and the town. On the next day,
when these guns opened their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
fire, the Federals were unable to reach the heights, while many men
were for hours in the iron hail-sweeping discharges of that artillery
that mowed them down by whole ranks, and yet the majority escaped alive.
We take the middle ground, and, while admitting that many escape alive
with a prepuce, claim that more are crippled than are visibly seen, as,
like Bret Harte&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heathen Chinee,&rdquo; the ways of the
prepuce are dark and mysterious as well as peculiar.</p>

<p>A discussion of the relative merits of religious creeds, when considered
in relation to health, has been, from the nature of the subject of the
book, unavoidable. Modern Christianity but very imperfectly explains why
this rite was either neglected or abolished. Frequent reference is made
to what Saint Paul said and did, but, as Saint Paul was not one of the
Disciples, it is inexplicable wherefrom he received his authority in
this matter, seeing that the Disciples themselves had no new views on
the subject. To the student who prefers to study his subject from all
its aspects, the question naturally arises, &ldquo;Where, when, and why
came the authority that abolished this rite?&rdquo; There is one
probable explanation, this being that Paul, who was the real promulgator
of Gentile Christianity, had to establish his creed among an
uncircumcised race; although, as we shall see, devotees have not
scrupled to sacrifice their virility in the hope of being more
acceptable to God and to be better able to observe His commandments, and
others, in their blind bigotry, have not objected to sitting naked on
sand-hills, with a six-inch iron ring passed through the prepuce, it is
very evident that the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s good sense showed him the
uselessness of attempting to found the new creed, and at the same time
hold on to the truly distinctive marking of Judaism among Gentiles, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the Hebrew race being those among whom he found the least converts, as
even the Disciples and Apostles in Palestine disagreed with him. In the
words of Dr. I. M. Wise, it was impossible for the Palestine Apostles,
or their flock, either to acknowledge Paul as one of their own set or
submit to his teaching; for they obeyed the Law and he abolished it;
they were sent to the house of Israel only, and Paul sought the Gentiles
with the message that the Covenant and the Law were at an end; they had
one gospel story and he another; they prophesied the speedy return of
the Master and a restoration of the throne of David in the kingdom of
heaven, and he prophesied the end of the world and the last day of
judgment to be at hand; they forbade their converts to eat of unclean
food, and especially of the sacrificial meats of the Pagans, and he made
light of both, as well as of the Sabbath and circumcision. In the
attempted reconciliation that subsequently took place in Jerusalem at
the house of James, the Jacob of Kaphersamia of the Talmud, Paul was
charged by the synod of Jewish Christians &ldquo;with disregarding the
Law, forsaking the teachings of Moses, and attempting to abolish
circumcision.&rdquo; He was bid to recant and undergo humiliation with
four other Nazarenes, that it might be known that he walked orderly and
observed the Law; Paul submitted to all that was demanded.</p>

<p>This, in short, with the exception of the sayings of Paul on the
subject, which are all secondary considerations, is really all that
there is relating to the abolishment of circumcision by the Christians.
The real Disciples and Apostles believed in Jesus with as much fervor as
Paul, but it is singular that they who were with the Master should
always have insisted on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
observance of the Law, while Paul as energetically insisted on its
abolishment.</p>

<p>From these premises, I have seen fit to inquire into the relative merits
of the three religions practiced by what we call the civilized nations,
as they affect man morally, physically, and mentally. I have given the
facts, my impressions, and reasons for being so impressed; from these,
the reader can easily see that religion has more to do with man&rsquo;s
temporal existence than is generally believed; its discussion is not,
therefore, out of place in this book.</p>

<p>Repetitions in the course of the work have been unavoidable. This is not
a novel nor a work of fiction, and wherever the want of repetition would
have been an injury, either to the proper representation of a fact or a
principle, the repetition has not been avoided. In describing the
operations, I had desired to avoid any too numerous descriptions, as
that is confusing, but have thought it best to give a number, as the
reader will thereby obtain the views of the different operators, the
mode of the operation often being an index to the view of the operator
in regard to the needs or utility of a prepuce. In the general plan of
the work, I have adopted the idea and the historical relation carried
out by Bergmann, of Strasburg, who included all the mutilations
practiced on the genitals while discussing the subject of circumcision,
they being, in the originality of performance, somewhat intimately
connected; this also tends to make the subject more interesting as a
contribution to the natural history of man,&mdash;something in which all
intelligent persons are more or less interested.</p>

<span class='sc sf75'>Antiquity of Circumcision.</span></h2>

<p>If the ceremonials of the Catholic Church or the High Church
Episcopalians carry us back into the depths of antiquity, or, as
remarked by Frothingham, that the ceremonies of St. Peter, at Rome,
carried him back to the mysteries of Eulesis, to the sacrificial rites
of ancient Ph&oelig;nicia, to what misty antiquity does not the
contemplation of the rite of circumcision take us? The Alexandrian
library, with its vast collection of precious records, could probably
have furnished us some information as to its origin and antiquity; but
Moslem fanaticism, with its belief in the all-sufficiency and
infallibility of the Koran, was the destruction of that wonderful
repository. We must now depend wholly on the relation of the Old
Testament or on what has since been written by the Greek and Italian
historians as to its origin and practices. The Egyptian monuments and
their hyeroglyphics give us no information on the subject further back
than the reign of Rameses II; while the oft-quoted Herodotus wrote some
fourteen centuries after the Old Testament relation, and Strabo and
Diodorus some nineteen centuries after the same chronicler. We have,
therefore, in their chronological order, first, the relation of the
Bible; then the Egyptian monuments and their revelations; and, thirdly,
the information gathered by Pythagoras, Herodotus, and other
philosophers and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
historians. To these three sources we may add the misty mixture of
tradition and mythological events, whose beginnings as to period of time
are indefinite. These are the sources from which we are to determine the
origin and antiquity as well as the character of the rite.</p>

<p>Voltaire found in the subject of circumcision one that he could not
satisfactorily make enter into his peculiar system of general
philosophy. For some reason, he did not wish that the Israelites should
have the credit of its introduction; were he to have admitted that, he
would have had to explain away the divine origin of the
rite,&mdash;something that the Hebrew has tenaciously held for over
thirty-seven centuries. Voltaire thought it would simplify the subject
by making it originate with the Egyptians, from whom the Hebrews were to
borrow it. To do this he adopted the relation of Herodotus on the
subject. His treatment of the Jewish race, however, brought out a strong
antagonism from those people to his attacks, and in a volume entitled,
&ldquo;Letters of Certain Jews to Monsieur Voltaire,&rdquo;&mdash;being
a series of criticisms on his aspersions on the race and on the writings
of the Old Testament (written by a number of Portuguese, German, and
Polish Jews then residing in Holland<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>),&mdash;they
proved conclusively that the Ph&oelig;nicians had borrowed the rite from
the Israelites, as they (the Ph&oelig;nicians) had practiced the rite on
the newborn, whereas, had they followed the Egyptian rite, they would
have only circumcised the child after its having passed its thirteenth
year,&mdash;these being the distinctive differences between the Jewish
and Egyptian rites.</p>

<p>Luckily, in the small temple of Khons, which formed an annex to the
greater temple of Maut, at Karnac, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
there was found a <i>bas-relief</i>, partly perfect, which goes far toward
giving light on the subject of Egyptian circumcision. The upper part of
the sculpture was so defaced that the upper portions of four of the five
figures were destroyed, but the lower portions were so perfect in every
detail as to furnish a full history of the age of the candidates for the
rite and the manner of its performance. It is further interesting from
the fact that it establishes also the time during which the rite was so
performed. M. Chabas and Dr. Ebers argue, from the founder of the temple
having been Rameses II, that the sculpture refers to the circumcision of
two of his children. The knife appears to be a stone implement, and the
operator kneels in front of the child, who is standing, while a matron
supports him in a kneeling posture, and she holds his hands from behind
him.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
In this <i>bas-relief</i> we can see the great difference that existed
between the two forms of the operation, that of the Hebrews being
performed, as a rule, on the eighth day after birth, while in the
<i>bas-relief</i> they are ten or twelve years old.</p>

<p>Although tradition and mythology veil past events in more or less
obscurity, they do, in regard to circumcision, furnish considerable
explanatory light on matters which would be otherwise hard to reconcile.
Circumcision has been performed by the Chippeways, on the Upper
Mississippi, and its modifications were performed among the Mexicans,
Central Americans, and some South American tribes of Indians, as well as
among many of the natives dwelling among the islands of the Pacific
Archipelago. There is a tradition, mentioned by Donnelly in connection
with the sunken continent of Atlantis, that Ouranos, one of the
Atlantean kings, ordered his whole army to be circumcised that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
might escape a fatal scourge then decimating the people to their
westward.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
This tradition tells us that the hygienic benefits of circumcision were
recognized antediluvian facts, as it also points out the way by which
circumcision traveled westward across to the Western World. As Donnelly
has pointed out, many of the Americans possessed not only traditions,
habits, and customs that must have come from the Old World, but the
similarity of many words and their meaning that exists between some of
the American languages and those of the indigenous inhabitants that have
still their remains in spots on the southwestern shores of
Europe&mdash;the ancient Armorica whose colony in Wales still retains
its ancient words&mdash;leaves no room for doubt that at one time a
landed highway existed between the two worlds. The Mandans, on the Upper
Missouri, have many words of undoubted Armorican origin in their
vocabulary,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
just as the Chiapenec, of Central America, contains its principal words
denotive of deity, family relations, and many conditions of life that
are identically the same as in the Hebrew,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
the name of father, son, daughter, God, king, and rich being essentially
the same in the two languages. It must have been more than a passing
coincidence that gives the Mandans some of their most expressive words
from the Welsh, or that gave to Central America many cities bearing
analogous names with the cities of Armenia.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Canadian names of localities, as well as those of the Mississippi
Valley, denote the French origin of their pioneers, as well as the names
of Upper California denote the nationality and creed of its first
settlers. So that there is nothing strange in asserting that American
civilization and many of the customs as found in the fifteenth century
by the early Spanish discoverers were nothing more <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
than the remains of ancient and modified Ph&oelig;nician civilization,
among which figured circumcision.</p>

<p>Dr. A. B. Arnold, of Baltimore, argues that, with the present state of
our anthropological knowledge and the material that research has been
able to furnish, we need no longer be surprised to find customs, laws,
and morals, among nations living in regions of the world widely apart
from each other, which betray an identity of origin and development, and
that beliefs and institutions, whether wise or aberrant, grow up under
apparently dissimilar circumstances, circumcision forming no
exception.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Dr. Arnold leaves too much to chance. It is hardly likely that the
similarity that existed between the architecture of the Ph&oelig;nicians
and the Central Americans, as evinced in their arches; in the beginning
of the century on the 26th of February; the advancement and interest
taken in astronomical science; the coexistence of pyramids in Egypt and
Central America; that five Armenian cities should have their namesakes
in Central America, should all be a matter of accident. The
historiographer of the Canary Islands, M. Benshalet, considers that
those islands once formed a part of the great continent to its west;
this has been verified by the discovery of many sculptured symbols,
similar in the Canaries and on the shores of Lake Superior, as well as
by the discovery of a mummy in the Canaries with sandals whose exact
counterparts were found in Central America.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
A compound word used to signify the Great Spirit being found identical
in the Welsh and Mandan languages, each requiring five distinct sounds
to pronounce, words as intricate as the passwords of secret societies,
can hardly be said to be the result of chance.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
There must, at some remote period, have existed some communication
between the ancestors of these Missouri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Mandans and the shores of ancient Armorica; the ancestors of these
Mandans may have then been living farther to the east; they even may
have then been a tribe of since lost Atlantis; but the analogy, not only
in regard to the word just mentioned,&mdash;<i>Maho-peneta</i>, of the Welsh
and Mandan,&mdash;but in the similarity of the pronouns of both
languages, and the existence of the idea of the counterpart of the
sacred white bull of the Egyptians being found among the Dakotas, or
Sioux, all point to the fact that these people, in common with the rest
of the Americans, originally came from the East; from whence came their
languages, manners, customs, rites, and what civilization they
possessed, among which circumcision has, through the mist of centuries,
held its own in some shape or other.</p>

<p>That some terrible catastrophe occurred to divide the hemispheres is
evident; the Western World remaining stationary in its civilization and
retaining the customs and rites of the times as evidence of their
origin. With this view of the case, the existence of circumcision as
found among the inhabitants of the West can easily be traced to its
origin among the hills of Chaldea. The ancient traditions and
mythological relations of the Egyptians in regard to the great nation to
the West are amply verified by the deep-sea soundings of the
&ldquo;Challenger,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Dolphin,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Gazelle,&rdquo; which plainly indicate the presence of a
submarine plateau that once formed the continent of Atlantis, whose only
visible evidence above the waves of the boisterous Atlantic is the
Azores and the remains of Ph&oelig;nician civilization among the Americans.</p>

<p>Professor Worman, of Brooklyn, scouts the idea that circumcision was
ever connected in any way or that it originated in any of the rites
connected with phallic <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
worship.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Bergmann,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of Strasburg, however, not only claims circumcision to be
a direct result of phallic worship, but looks upon the rite as something
that has been reached by what may be termed a gradual evolutionary
process of manners, customs, and society, from the time of what is
termed the hero-warrior period of traditional history, when war and the
clashing of shields and sword or spear were the main delights and
occupations of man. It is strange to note what difference must have
existed between these hero-warriors in regard to their ideas of
manliness; some were brutal and fiendish, whilst others were
magnanimous. McPherson, the historiographer of early Britain, cannot
help but contrast the superior manliness of the heroes of Ossian in his
graphic description of the ancient Caledonians, when compared to the
brutality of Homer&rsquo;s Greek heroes. The traditions upon which
Bergmann undertakes to found the origin of the rite of circumcision are
all connected with the inhuman and brutish passions that animated our
barbarous ancestry. The first incident given is the Egyptian traditional
tragedy, which was, in all probability, the initial point of that
phallic worship which, with increasing debauchery, assisted in the final
demoralization of Rome and Greece, after its introduction into those
countries.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>Theories as to the Origin of Circumcision.</span></h2>

<p>We are told that in battle man looked upon the vanquished as unfit to
bear the name of man, looking upon the weakness or want of skill which
contributed to their defeat as something effeminate. The victor then
proceeded by a very summary and effective mode, done in the most
primitive and expeditious manner, to render his victim as much like a
female as possible to all outward appearances; this was accomplished by
a removal at one sweep of <i>all</i> the organs of generation, the phallus
being generally retained as a trophy,&mdash;a practice which was also carried
into effect with dead enemies, to show that the victor had vanquished
<i>men</i>. It has been the practice from time immemorial for a victor to
carry off some portion of the body of his victim or defeated enemy, as a
mark or testimony of his prowess; it was either a hand, head or scalp,
lower jaw, or finger. The carrying off of the phallus or virile member
was considered the most conclusive proof of the nature of the
vanquished, and, as it established the sex, it conferred a greater title
to bravery and skill than a mere collection of hands or scalps, which
would not denote the sex. In conformity with this custom, we find that
Osiris, when he returned to Egypt and found that Typhon had fomented
dissension in his absence, being vanquished by the latter in the
conflict that followed, was dismembered and cut into pieces, the
followers of Typhon each securing a piece and Typhon himself securing
the phallus or generative member. Isis, the spouse of Osiris, seems in
turn to have secured the control of government, and, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
having secured all the pieces of the dissected Osiris except the
phallus,&mdash;Typhon having fled with that, and, according to some
traditions, having thrown it into the sea,&mdash;Isis ordered that
statues should be constructed, each to contain a piece of the
unfortunate Osiris, who should thereafter be worshiped as a god, and
that the priesthood should choose from among the animals some one kind
which should thereafter be considered sacred. The phallus which was
missing was ordered special worship, with more marked solemnities and
mysteries; from this originated the phallic worship and the sacredness
of the white bull, Apis, among the Egyptians, which was chosen to
represent Osiris.</p>

<p>By gradual evolution and the progress of society, the cultivation of the
ground and the need of menials, warriors found some other use for their
prisoners taken in strife besides merely cutting off the phallus as a
trophy; these prisoners began to have some intrinsic value. From this a
change came about; the warrior instinct, however, still claimed that the
vanquished, even if a slave, should still convey or carry some sign of
servitude. The original idea of the ablation of the phallus was to
emasculate the victim; investigation developed the idea that the same
object could be accomplished by castration, an operation which also
finally reached a tolerable state of perfection through different stages
of evolution, it first being performed by a complete removal of the
whole scrotum and contents. This operation, with the ignorance of the
times in regard to stopping h&aelig;morrhage, was, however, accompanied by a
large mortality, and it finally evolved into the simple removal of the
gland, or its obliteration by pressure or violence. Bergmann conveys the
idea that circumcision was at one time the indestructible marking and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the distinctive feature of the slave, the mind of the period not being
able to emancipate itself from the idea that the genitals must in some
manner be mutilated, not being able to conceive any other degrading mark
of manhood which barbarians felt they must inflict on slaves.</p>

<p>The generally accepted idea in regard to the physical mutilation of
captives taken in war, or that some token from the body of the
vanquished must be carried off by the victor, has not only the support
of tradition and monumental sculptured evidence, but its practice is
still in vogue among many races. Among the ancient Scythians, only the
warriors who returned from the battle or foray with the heads of the
enemy were entitled to a share in the spoils. Among the modern Berbers
it is still a practice for a young man, on proposing marriage, to
exhibit to his prospective father-in-law the virile members of all the
enemies he has overcome, as evidence of his manhood and right to the
title of warrior. The Abyssinians and some of the negro tribes on the
Guinea coast still follow the custom of securing the phallus of a fallen
foe. However barbarous this practice may seem, its actual performance is
only secondary, the primary motive being that the warrior wished to
prove that he had been there, engaged in actual strife, and that his
enemy had been overcome. The writer remembers that, after one of the
battles in the West during the late war, many letters arrived in his
locality with pieces of the garments or locks of the hair of the
unfortunate Confederate general, Zollikoffer, who had been slain in the
battle; a disposition in the warrior, seemingly still existing, such as
animated the old Egyptians. On an old Egyptian monument,&mdash;that of
Osymandyas,&mdash;Diodorus noticed a mural sculpture, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a <i>bas-relief</i> representing prisoners of war, either in chains or bound
with cords, being registered by a royal scribe preparatory to losing
either the right hand or the phallus, a pile of which is visible in one
corner of the foreground; from this sculpture we learn that the practice
was not only an individual performance, but that it was a national usage
among the Egyptians as well, who subjected, at times, their vanquished
foes to its ordeal in a wholesale but business-like manner.</p>

<p>Bergmann argues that the Israelites were given to like practices, and
cites the incident wherein David brought two hundred prepuces&mdash;as
evidence of his having slaughtered that number of Philistines&mdash;to Saul,
as a mark of his being worthy to be his son-in-law. He argues that,
whereas many have made that Old Testament passage to read &ldquo;two
hundred prepuces,&rdquo; it should have read &ldquo;two hundred virile
members&rdquo; which David and his companions had cut off from the
Philistines, the word <i>orloth</i> meaning the virile member, and not the
prepuce. That Israelitish circumcision could have originated from either
phallic worship or any of the hero-warrior usages is untenable as a
proposition, as regards the living prisoners, and is contrary to the
monotheistic idea which ruled Israel, or to the benign nature of their
God. The strict opposition of the religion of Judaism to any other
mutilation except that of the covenant is also antagonistic to the views
advanced by Bergmann, as it is well known that even emasculated animals
were considered imperfect and unclean, and therefore unfit to be
received or offered as a sacrifice to their deity. No emasculated man
was allowed to enter the priesthood or assist at sacrifices. The whole
idea of Judaism being opposed to such mutilations, their observance of
circumcision and its <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
performance can in no way have developed from either phallic or other
warlike rites or usages; but we must accept its origin as a purely
religious rite,&mdash;a covenant of the most rigid observance,
coincident in its inception with the formation of the Hebraic creed in
the hills of Chaldea.</p>

<p>What Herodotus or Pythagoras may have written concerning the practice
among the Egyptians was written, as already remarked, some nine
centuries after Moses had recorded his laws; Moses himself having come
some centuries after Abraham. Herodotus is quoted as representing that
the Ph&oelig;nicians borrowed the practice from the Egyptians, in support
of the theory that Egypt was the central nucleus from whence the
practice started, and not that it traveled toward Egypt from
Ph&oelig;nicia. The difference in the ages, already mentioned, at which the
rite was practiced&mdash;that of Ph&oelig;nicia and Israel being at one time
identical&mdash;shows that the testimony of Herodotus in this one particular
was the result of faulty judgment, as we find the people who have
borrowed the practice from the Egyptians, as well as their descendants,
closely follow their practice in regard to the age at which the
operation should be performed. Another evidence of the strictly
religious nature of the rite, as far as the Hebrews are concerned, lies
in the fact that, with all their skill in surgery and medical
sciences,&mdash;they being at one time the only intelligent exponents of our
science,&mdash;they never made any alteration or improvement in the manner of
performing the operation. It is evident that even Maimonides, a
celebrated Jewish physician of the twelfth century, who furnished some
rules in regard to the operation, was held under some constraint by the
religious aspect of the rite. As a summary of this part of the subject,
it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
may be stated that the Old Testament furnished the only reliable and
authentic relation prior to Pythagoras and Herodotus. From its evidence,
Abraham was the first to perform the operation, which he seems to have
performed on himself, his son, and servants,&mdash;in all, numbering
nearly four hundred males; he then dwelt in Chaldea. In absence of other
as reliable evidence we must accept this testimony in regard to its
origin, causes, and antiquity.</p>

<p>Voltaire, in his article on circumcision in his &ldquo;Philosophical
Dictionary,&rdquo; seems more intent on breaking down any testimony that
might favor belief in any religion than to impart any useful light or
information. He bases all his arguments on the book
&ldquo;Euterpe,&rdquo; of Herodotus, wherein he relates that the Colchis
appear to come from Egypt, as they remembered the ancient Egyptians and
their customs more than the Egyptians remembered either the Colchis or
their customs; the Colchis claimed to be an Egyptian colony settled
there by Sesostris and resembled the Egyptians. Voltaire claims that, as
the Jews were then in a small nook of Arabia Petrea, it is hardly likely
that, they being then an insignificant people, the Egyptians would have
borrowed any of their customs. To read Voltaire&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Herodotus&rdquo; is somewhat convincing, but Voltaire&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Herodotus&rdquo; and Herodotus writing himself are two different
things, and the book &ldquo;Euterpe&rdquo; says quite another thing from
what M. Voltaire makes it say. A perusal of Voltaire and a study of his
Jewish critics on this subject, as found in the &ldquo;Jews&rsquo;
Letters to Voltaire,&rdquo; will convince any reader that as to
circumcision M. Voltaire is an unreliable authority.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>Spread of Circumcision.</span></h2>

<p>From Chaldea, then, in the mountains of Armenia and Kurdistan, the
practice of circumcision was, in all probability, first adopted by the
Ph&oelig;nicians, who finally relinquished the Israelitish rite as to age
of performance and exchanged it for the Egyptian rite. From Ph&oelig;nicia
its spread through the maritime enterprises of this race to foreign
parts was easy. Egypt was the next place to adopt its practice; at first
the priesthood and nobility, which included royalty, were the only ones
who availed themselves of the practice. The Egyptians connected
circumcision with hygiene and cleanliness; this was the view of
Herodotus, who looked upon the rite as a strictly hygienic measure.
History relates of the existence of circumcision among the Egyptians as
far back as the reign of Psamm&eacute;tich, who ruled toward the end of the
sixth century <span class='sc lc'>B.C.</span> The practice must then have been of a very religious
and national nature, as we are told that Psamm&eacute;tich, having admitted
some noted strangers, whom he allowed to dwell in Egypt without being
circumcised, brought himself into great disfavor among his subjects, and
especially by the army, who looked upon an uncircumcised stranger as one
undeserving of favors. During the next century Pythagoras visited Egypt,
and was compelled to submit to be circumcised before being admitted to
the privilege of studying in the Egyptian temples. In the following
century these restrictions were removed, for neither Herodotus nor
Diodorus, who visited the country, were obliged to be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
circumcised, either to dwell among the people or to follow their
studies. There is one curious habit that is mentioned in connection with
the rite of circumcision among these people, this being its relation to
the taking of an oath or a solemn obligation. Among the Egyptians the
circumcised phallus, as well as the rite of circumcision, seemed to be
the symbol of the religious as well as of the political community, and
the circumcised member was emblematical of civil patriotism as well as
of the orthodox religion of the nation. To the Egyptian, his circumcised
phallus was the symbol of national and religious honor; and as the
Anglo-Saxon holds aloft his right hand, with his left resting on the
holy Bible, while taking an oath, so the ancient Egyptian raised his
circumcised phallus in token of sincerity,&mdash;a practice not
altogether forgotten by his descendants of to-day. It was partly this
custom of swearing, or of affirming, with the hand under the thigh, by
the early Israelites, that caused many to believe that their
circumcision was borrowed from the Egyptians, especially by M. Voltaire,
who insists that it was the phallus that the hand was placed on, and
that the translation has not the proper meaning, as given in the Bible.</p>

<p>Among the Arabs it was the practice to circumcise at the age of thirteen
years, this being the age of Ishmael at his circumcision by his father,
Abraham. The Arabs practiced circumcision long before the advent of
Mohammed, who was himself circumcised. Pococke mentions a tradition
which ascribes to the prophet the words, &ldquo;Circumcision is an
ordinance for men, and honorable in women.&rdquo; Although the rite is
not a religious imposition, it has spread wherever the crescent has
carried the Mohammedan faith. Uncircumcision and impurity are to a
Mohammedan synonymous terms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Like the Abyssinians, the Arabs also practice female
circumcision,&mdash;an operation not without considerable medical
import, as will be explained in the medical part of the work. This
practice is also common in Ethopia. Some authorities argue, from this
association of female circumcision among the Southern Arabs, Ethiopians,
and Abyssinians, that they did not derive their rite from the
Israelites; but there is not much room for doubt but that the operation
came down to the Arabians from Abraham through his son Ishmael.
Considering the occupancy of Syria, Arabia, and Egypt by the French, and
the intercourse with these countries by the British, it is surprising
that the profession in the early part of the present century had not
full information regarding the nature and objects of female circumcision
as practiced in these countries. Delpesh observes, in relation to the
Oriental practice, that his information was too vague to determine
whether it was the nymph&aelig; or the clitoris that were removed, or
whether it was only practiced in cases of abnormal elongations of these
parts. M. Murat, however, writes at length on the subject, very
intelligently, as well as Lonyer-Villermay, who, writing in the same
work with Delpesh, thinks it is certainly the clitoris that is
removed.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
In Arabia, the trade or profession of a <i>resectricis nympharum</i> or
she-circumciser is as stable an occupation with some matrons as that of
cock-castration or caponizing is the sole occupation of many a matron in
the south of Europe. It is related by Abulfeda that, in the battle of
Ohod, where Mohammedanism came very near to a sudden end by the crushing
defeat of the prophet and his followers, Hamza, the uncle of the
prophet, seeing in the opposing ranks a Koreish chief, whom he knew,
thus called out: &ldquo;Come on, you son of a she-circumciser!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
As Hamza was among the slain, it is most likely that he met his death
from the hands of the chief, whose mother really followed that
occupation. So extensive is the practice, that these old women sometimes
go through a village crying out their occupation, like itinerant tinkers
or scissors-grinders.</p>

<p>The present ceremonies attending the performance of the rite among the
Arabians are well described by Dr. Delange, a surgeon of the French
army, as witnessed by him in the province of Constantine, in Algeria.</p>

<p>With these Arabs, circumcision is performed on a whole class, so to
speak, at the same time, regardless of the trifling differences in their
ages. It is preceded by feasting, the total length of the feast being
for eight days. For the first seven days, all the Arabs of the quarter
where the candidates for circumcision reside dress in their best. The
poor have their mantles and clothes carefully washed, and the rich deck
themselves out in their gold and silver brocaded vests and pantaloons.
During these seven days there is general rejoicing, and the Arabs spend
most of this time in the village street, racing, firing guns, or
engaging in sham battles between the different camps, during which one
carries the green, or sacred banner, which is supposed to render the
bearer invulnerable. The battle ends by the standard-bearer being fired
at by all parties, and falling, but quickly rising again and waving the
flag in token of its protecting power. The Arabs now adjourn to another
public place, where the notables and strangers are furnished seats on
carpets; here a dance to the music of tumtums and the singing of
invisible females takes place, the dancers being only males.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
In the evening the women sing, to which the men listen in silence, this
concert being kept up until midnight. On the seventh day, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
women, decked out in their best, and with all their personal ornaments,
accompanied by all the young men, armed with their guns and pistols,
repair to the extremity of the oasis, where they gather plates of fine
sand. With this sand they return to the village, where it is exposed
overnight to the glare of the full moon on the terraces of the house.
This last day closes with a grand banquet, given by the rich whose
children are about to be circumcised, to which all the people are
invited.</p>

<p>The next morning all the relatives of the candidates repair to the house
where the rite is to be performed; the women going up into the second
floor, wherefrom they can look down into the court from a porch screened
with lattice-work, without themselves being seen. The men gather
together on the ground-floor, together with the operator and his
assistants and the children about to be circumcised, who are dressed in
yellow, silken gowns. The child to be operated upon is seated in a pan
of sand, while an assistant fixes his arms and holds the thighs well
separated from behind. The circumciser then examines the prepuce, the
glans, and removes any sebaceous collection. This done, a compress with
an aperture to admit of the passage of the glans is slipped over the
organ; a small piece of leather, some six centimetres in diameter, with
a small hole in the centre, is now used, the free end of the prepuce
being drawn through the aperture; a ligature of woolen cord is then tied
on to the prepuce next to the front of the leather shield, and, the
knife being applied between the thread and the leather, the prepuce is
removed at one sweep; the mucous inner layer is then lacerated with the
thumb-nails and turned back over to join the other parts. The surface is
then sprinkled with <i>arar</i> or <i>genevriere</i> powder and dressed with a
small cloth bandage, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the subsequent dressings consisting of <i>arar</i> powder and oil. During
the operation the women in the gallery keep up an unearthly music by
means of tumtums, cymbals, and all the kettles and saucepans of the
neighborhood, which are brought into requisition for the occasion. This
music is accompanied with songs and chants, each woman striking out with
an independent song of her own, either improvised or suggested by the
occasion. This not only serves to drown the cries of the children, but
it must, in a manner, assist to draw them away from the immediate
contemplation of their sufferings. The prepuces are now gathered
together and carried to the end of the oasis, where they are buried with
ceremony and rejoicings. This circumcision only takes place once in
three or four years, and the children are from four to eight years of
age; of fifteen circumcised at the feast witnessed by M. Delange, only
two had passed their eighth year.</p>

<p>In a very interesting old book,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
&ldquo;The Treaties of Alberti Bobovii,&rdquo; who was attached to the
court of Mohammed IV, published with annotations by Thomas Hyde, of
Oxford, in 1690, there is a description of the Turkish performance of
the rite which leads one to infer that they circumcised the children
quite young: &ldquo;Et cum puer pr&aelig; dolore exclamat, imus ex
duobus parentibus digitis in melle ad hoc comparato os ei obstruit;
c&aelig;teris spectatoribus acclamantibus. O Deus, O Deus, O Deus.
Interim quoque Musica perstrepit, tympana et alia crepitacula
concutiuntur, ne pueri planctus et ploratus audiatur.&rdquo; Bobovii
says that the age at which circumcision is performed is immaterial
provided the candidate is old enough to make a profession of
faith,&mdash;which, however, is made for him by the godfather,&mdash;in
the following words: &ldquo;There is no God but God, and Mohammed is his
Prophet,&rdquo; or, as rendered by our <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
author, &ldquo;Non esse Deum nisi ipsum Deum, et Mohammedem esse
Legatum Dei.&rdquo; To which he adds that the child must not be an
infant, but that he must be at least eight years of age. Like to the
Arabs, the Turks celebrated the occasion by feasts, plays, and a general
good time; the child was kept in bed for fifteen days to allow complete
cicatrization to take place. The circumcision was performed with the boy
standing.</p>

<p>Michel Le Feber, writing in 1681,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
speaks of the tax levied on the Christians by the Turks, that they, the
Christians, may enjoy liberty of conscience, and observes that,
circumcision not being compulsory among the Turks, it often led to
trouble and annoyances, as many of the Turks evaded the operation. The
tax-gatherers in Turkey are very industrious, and, as being circumcised
was, as a rule, sufficient evidence of not being a Christian, he often
witnessed on the streets scenes wherein strangers, arrested by these
tax-collectors, were compelled to show their circumcision as an
indisputable sign of their exemption from the tax. He also relates that
in their zeal for converts to Mohammedanism the Turks often resorted to
presents to induce Christians to embrace their faith. While in Aleppo,
he saw a Portugese sailor, who, through presents, had forsaken his
religion, but who had repented in the most emphatic manner when brought
to face circumcision. Finding entreaties in vain, the Cadi ordered the
immediate administration of a stupefying draught, and the sailor was
then seized and circumcised without further ceremony.</p>

<p>In cases where the new Mohammedan is reasonable and submits like a hero,
the ceremonies are more elaborate. Le Feber relates that if the
candidate is a man of note or wealth he is mounted on a horse and
exhibited all over the city; he is dressed in the richest of Turkish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
robes and in his hand he holds an arrow with the point directed to the
sky; he is followed by a great concourse of people, some dressed in
holiday attire and others in fantastic costumes; and general feasting
and enjoyment is the rule over the course of the march, where all the
people run to swell the crowd. If the man happens to be a poor man, he
is simply hurriedly marched about on foot, with a simple arrow in his
hand pointed skyward, to distinguish him from ordinary mortals; before
him a crier proclaims in a loud voice that the new religionist has
ennobled himself by professing the faith of the prophet in this solemn
manner. A collection for his benefit is taken up among the booths and
shops, which is mostly appropriated by the conductor, circumciser, and
his assistants, after which he is circumcised without further ado.</p>

<p>The same author describes the operation as performed on the young Turks
and the accompanying ceremonies. They differ in some respects from those
employed in circumcising a convert. The parents of the child give a
feast in proportion to their means, to which are invited the relatives
of the family and personal friends; if of the upper ranks, he is
promenaded about the town to the music of drums and cymbals, dressed in
rich attire; two warriors lead the procession with drawn swords, and a
troop of females who sing songs of joy bring up the rear; the procession
now and then stops, when the two gladiators in the front indulge in a
fierce set-to, hacking at each other in the most determined and
murderous manner, but so studiedly shammy that neither is injured; on
the return to the house, the child, who is usually eight or ten years of
age, is bound hand and foot to prevent his causing any injury to
himself, laid on a bed, and circumcised with a razor, the operation
being performed either by a surgeon or the chief of a mosque.</p>

who, in the capacity of missionary, for a very long time resided among
the Bassoutos, tells us that among that nation the operation is
performed at the age of from thirteen to fifteen years. The ceremony is
gone through once in three or four years. So important an event is it
considered by the Bassoutos that they date events from one of these
observances, as the Romans dated events from a certain consulship, or
the Greeks from an Olympiade. At the time fixed, all the candidates go
through a sham rebellion and escape to the woods; the warriors arm and
give chase, and, after a sham battle, capture the insurgents, whom they
bring back as prisoners, amidst dancing and great rejoicings, which are
the preludes to the feast. The next day the huts of mystery (<i>mapato</i>)
are erected, where, after the circumcision, the young men are to reside
for some eight months, under the tutorship of experienced teachers, who
drill them in the use of the spear, sword, and shield, teaching them to
endure hunger, thirst, blows, and all manner of hardships; prolonged
fasts and cruel flagellations being regarded as pastimes between the
exercises. The severity of the regulations may be judged from the fact
that the instructors have a right to put to death any one who may try to
escape from these ordeals. The women are rigorously excluded from these
camps, but the men are allowed to visit them, when they have the
privilege of assisting the teachers by adding additional blows and
precepts to the backs of the unlucky candidates.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
After eight months of such training, the young men are oiled from head
to foot and dressed in a garment, and are now given the name which they
are to bear for the rest of their lives. The <i>mapato</i>, or mystery hut,
is now burned to the ground and the young men return to the village. The
maternal uncle of the youth here presents him with a javelin for his
defense, and a cow that is to furnish him with nourishment. Until the
time of his marriage, the newly circumcised dwell together; their duties
being of a menial character, such as gathering wood and attending to the
flocks and droves.</p>

<p>M. Paul Lafargue looks upon circumcision among the negro races as being
a rite commemorating their advent to manhood; Livingstone, who has also
observed the above, related incidents in relation to the performance of
<i>boguera</i>, or circumcision, among the Bassoutos, believes that with them
the rite has a purely civil significance, being in no way connected with
religion.</p>

<p>Among many of the African tribes the young maids have an ordeal
approaching to circumcision that they must pass when near the age of
thirteen, this rite bearing precisely the same relation regarding their
entrance into the state of womanhood that male circumcision denotes the
entrance into manhood on the part of the males among the Bassoutos. At
the appointed time the maids are gathered together and conducted to the
riverbank; they are placed under the care of expert matrons. They here
reside, after having undergone a kind of baptism; they are maltreated,
punished, and abused by the old women, with a view of making them hardy
and insensible to pain; they are also schooled in the science and art of
African household duties. Among the Gallinas of Sierra Leone, in
addition to the other observances, the clitoris of the young maid is
excised at midnight, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
while the moon is at its full, after which they receive their name by
which they are to be known through life. The initiation of each sex into
these mysteries is exclusively for the sex engaged, and it would be as
fatal for a man to steal into the camp of the women during the
performance of these ceremonies as it would be fatal for a woman to
enter a <i>mapato</i> where the young men are undergoing their ordeal. After
their initiation into womanhood, the maids live by themselves, similarly
to the young men, until they marry.</p>

<p>Lafargue relates that among the Australians circumcision is held in such
importance that tribes at war will suspend all hostilities and meet in
peace during the observance or performance of the rite. Here, again, we
have a repetition, with a slight variation, of the practices of the
Bassoutos,&mdash;something which gives some countenance to the hero-warrior
idea of the origin of circumcision advanced by Bergmann. The Australian
warriors go through a mimic battle, and, after a series of combats,
finally capture the boys aged about from thirteen to fourteen years,
whom they bear away amidst the cries and lamentations of the mothers and
other female relatives, who, in their excess of grief, mutilate
themselves by cutting gashes into their thighs, so that they bleed
profusely. The boys are, in the meantime, carried to some out-of-the-way
place, where an old man, perched on a tree or some rising ground,
through the means of a musical instrument made of a deal-board and human
hair, announced that the rite is in process of performance, so that
neither women nor children might approach. Tufts of moss are placed in
the axilla and on the pubis, to represent puberty, and among some tribes
the skin of the penis is divided to the scrotum with a stone knife,
while others content themselves <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with simply making a circular incision, which removes the prepuce,
after the Jewish manner, the excised portion being placed as a ring on
the median finger of the left hand. The circumcised then takes himself
to the hills or woods, and there remains until healed, carefully
guarding himself against the approach of any female. After this the
third part of the ceremonies takes place: the godfather of the youth
opens a vein in his own arm, the circumcised youth is placed on
all-fours, and an incision is made from the neck down as far as the
lumbar region, and the blood of the godfather is made to flow and mingle
with that of the godchild; this being in reality a bloody baptism, and a
near relation to the blood-compacts of the Arabs.</p>

<p>The Malays, as well as the men of Borneo, are circumcised. The Battos
likewise perform the rite. Among the Islanders they sometimes ligate the
prepuce so that it drops off. Among the Battos the same object is
reached by small bamboo sticks, between which the prepuce is fastened.
In New Caledonia and Tidshi the boys are circumcised in their seventh
year. The Tonga Islanders split the prepuce on the dorsum with a piece
of bamboo or of shell. In the Marquesas and Sandwich Islands the
operation is superintended by the priests.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>It seems a matter of controversy as to whether the Mexicans did or did
not circumcise their children. That they had a blood-covenant is
admitted by the historians, as well as the fact that this blood was
taken from the prepuce; but that the prepuce was actually removed is
something that is not agreed upon by all authorities. Las Casas and
Mendieta state that it was practiced by the Aztecs and Totonacs, while
Brasseur de Bourbourg found traces of its practice among the Mijes. Las
Casas states that on the twenty-eighth or the twenty-ninth day the child
was presented to the temple, when the high-priest and his assistants
placed it upon a stone and cut off the prepuce, the excised part being
afterward burnt in the ashes. Girls of the same age were deflowered by
the finger of the high-priest, who ordered the operation to be repeated
at the sixth year; and once a year, at the fifth month, all the children
born during the year were scarified on the breast, stomach, or arms, to
denote their reception as servants of their god. Clavigero, on the other
hand, denies that circumcision was ever practiced. It was customary in
Mexico, according to most authorities, to take the children while
infants to the temple, where the priests made an incision in the ear of
the females, and an incision in the ear and prepuce of the males.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Grotins and Arias Montan at one time advanced the idea that the western
coast of South America was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
peopled by some mutinous sailors from the fleets of King Solomon, who,
in their endeavor to go away far enough to be out of reach, were driven
by winds and chance to the Peruvian coast. Others have imagined that
some of the lost tribes of Israel found their way eastward to America,
by the way of China, to the Mexican coast. The same ideal tradition has
made the lost tribes the fathers of the Iroquois Nation in the
northeastern parts of the United States. An author, who will be quoted
in another part of this work, scouts the idea that the rite, as
performed in America, had any connection or common origin with the rite
performed in Asia and Africa; but, true to his theory of the climatic
causes of the origin of circumcision, he maintains that it originated
here as it did elsewhere, being a performance born of climatic
necessity. He is, however, dissatisfied with Father Acosta for not being
more explicit in relation to the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Mexican
circumcision. The want of being explicit, and its consequences in this
particular regard, may be inferred from a &ldquo;Diatribe on
Circumcision,&rdquo; by a Mr. Mallet, in an encyclop&aelig;dic
dictionary of the last century, in which Mr. Mallet informs his readers
that Mexicans were in the habit of <i>cutting off the ears and prepuces</i>
of the newly born. Herrera and Acosta agree with Clavigero in asserting
that the Mexicans simply <i>bled</i> the prepuce. Pierre d&rsquo;Angleria and
other contemporary writers are as emphatic in asserting that in the
island of Cosumel, in Yucatan, on the sea-board of the Gulf of Mexico
and on the Florida coast, they have observed circumcision by the
complete removal of the prepuce with a stone knife. The Spanish monk,
Gumilla, relates that the Saliva Indians of the Orinoco circumcised
their infants on the eighth day. These Indians also included <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the females in the observance of the rite. The same author tells us of
the barbarous and bloody performances, in relation to the rite, of the
nations on the banks of the Quilato and the Uru, as well as those
dwelling along the streams that empty into the Apure. The same is said
of the Guamo and of the Othomacos Indians; according to Gumilla, many of
these Indians, in addition to the rite of circumcision, inflicted a
number of cuts on the arms, legs, and over the body, to a degree that
amounted to butchery, the child being reserved for this inhuman
treatment until the age of ten or twelve years, that he might, by his
greater powers of resistance and of recuperation, stand some chance of
escaping alive from the ordeal. The friar mentions that in 1721 he found
a child dying from this treatment, the wounds having become gangrenous
and the child dying of py&aelig;mia; prior to the operation the children
were stupefied with some narcotic drink, and were insensible during its
performance.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Besides circumcision, the Americans practiced several other operations
that bore an analogy to the operation of infibulation, a procedure
common to the Orient and to early Europe, and so ancient that, like
circumcision, its source is in the misty clouds of antiquity. It
consisted in introducing a large ring, either of gold, silver, or iron,
through an opening made into the prepuce, the free ends being then
welded together. Females were treated likewise, the ring including both
labia. In some countries an agglutination of the parts induced by some
irritant or a cutting instrument answered the purpose among females.
Dunglison mentions that the prepuce was first drawn over the glans, and
then that the ring transfixed the prepuce in that position; that the
ancients so muzzled the gladiators to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
prevent them from being enervated by venereal indulgence. The ancient
Germans lived a life of chastity until their marriage, and to their
observance of a chaste life can be attributed the superior physical
development of the race, as both males and females were not only fully
developed, but were not enervated by either sexual excess or
inclinations before having offspring, which were necessarily robust and
healthy. To obtain the same results in a nation given to indolence and
luxury, and lax in its morality, some physical restraint was required,
and we therefore find the practice of infibulation coming from the warm
countries to the East. The ancients not only infibulated their
gladiators to restrain them from venery, but they also subjected their
chanters and singers to the same ordeal, as it was found to improve the
voice; comedians and public dancers were also restrained from ruining
their talents by the means of infibulation. In an old Amsterdam edition
of Locke&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essay on the Extent of the Human
Understanding,&rdquo; there is a quotation from the voyages of
Baumgarten, wherein he states having seen in Egypt a devout dervish
seated in a perfect state of nature among the sand-hillocks, who was
regarded as a most holy and chaste man for the reason that he did not
associate with his own kind, but only with the animals. As this was by
no means an uncommon case, it led the Greek monks, in Greece and Asia
Minor, to resort to every expedient to protect their chastity; in some
of the monasteries not only were the monks muzzled by the process of
infibulation, but they even had rules that excluded all females, either
human or animal, from within their convent,&mdash;a habit that still
prevails among many of the convents of the Orient to this
day,&mdash;that on Mount Athos especially, omitting the infibulation of
the ancients.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Readers living in the climates of extreme ranges and of seasonal change
cannot understand the physical temptations that beset mortals in certain
climates, any more than they can imagine the faultless condition of the
climate itself. The subject of climatic influences will be more fully
discussed further on; but climate, as a factor of habits and usages in
one part of the world, that are incomprehensible to those living in
others, plays a part that is but little appreciated or understood;
whether it be the question of diet, dress, or custom, climate exerts its
influence in no uncertain manner. As Sulpicius Severus remarked to the
Greek monks, when they accused the Gaulish monks with voracity and
gluttony, &ldquo;That which you of Greece consider as superfluous, the
climate of Gaul renders into a positive necessity.&rdquo; So of all
physical needs and passions,&mdash;they are subject to a similar law. Those
who have read Canon Kingsley&rsquo;s small work on the &ldquo;Hermits of
Asia, Africa, and Europe&rdquo; will appreciate the above remarks; and
it may be incidentally mentioned that his description of the climate
that is common to the hilly country bordering on the eastern half of the
Mediterranean Sea gives as vivid and as graphic a description of the
physical condition of the climate and of its effects as can well be
written. It occurs in the life of the hermit Hilarion, and the
description given relates to his last home in the ruins of an old
temple, situated on a cliff in the island of Cyprus, where the air is so
invigorating that &ldquo;man needs there hardly to eat, drink, or sleep,
for the act of breathing will give life enough.&rdquo; The work gives
the best insight also into origin and causes that led to monachism, as
well as it tells the benefit that the condition conferred on humanity,
showing a phase in the march of civilization that is but little
understood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
But, to return to the subject of infibulation, which has, in a manner,
necessitated this digression from the main topic. Thwing<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
informs us that in ancient Germany woman was considered the moral equal
of man, and that woman might traverse the vast stretches of country
unprotected and unharmed. Woman never held such a position in the
Oriental countries; neither has man, under the sub-tropics, a like
self-command as shown by those ancient Gauls. So that, with the advent
of Christianity and the moral revolution that followed, primitive
methods, either inflicted on others or self-inflicted, were adopted to
insure a chaste life. Infibulation was known, as already stated, for
centuries, and in those rude times it seemed as the most natural and
effective mode of accomplishing the object. It was not as barbarous an
operation as emasculation on the male, as it only temporarily interfered
with his functions.</p>

<p>In the Old World the practice is still performed in various manners. In
Ethiopia, when a female child is born the vulva is stitched together,
allowing only the necessary passage for the needs of nature. These parts
adhere together, and the father is then possessed of a virgin which he
can sell to the highest bidder, the union being severed with a sharp
knife just before marriage. In some parts of Africa and Asia, a ring, as
before stated, transfixed the labia, which, to be removed, required
either a file or a chisel; this is worn only by virgins. Married women
wear a sort of muzzle fastened around the body, locked by means of a key
or a padlock, the key being only in the possession of the husband. The
wealthy have their seraglios and eunuchs, that take the place of the
belt and lock. Another method is a mailed belt worn about the hips, made
of brass wire, with a secret combination of fastenings, known only to
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
husband. In the museum in Naples are to be seen some of these belts,
studded with sharp-pointed pikes over the abdominal part of the
instrument, which was calculated to prevent even innocent familiarity,
such as nest-hiding, to say nothing of greater evils.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Les Femmes, Les Eunuchs, et Les Guerrieres du
Soudan,&rdquo; Col. Du Bisson mentions a very peculiar custom invented
by the careful jealousy that is inseparable from harem life. He had
noticed that many of the harem inmates, contrary to the general Oriental
custom, were allowed to go about unattended by the usual guard of
eunuchs, but that they walked in a painful, hesitating, and impeded
manner. This walk was not the conventional, short, shuffling step that
peculiarity of dress and shoe-wear imposes on the Japanese beauty, nor
the willowy, swaying gait produced in the Chinese beauty by the lack of
a sufficiency of foot; neither could it be ascribed to the presence of
the ancient jingling chain of bells which induced the mincing steps of
the virgins of Judea,&mdash;an invention which confined the lower limbs
within certain limits by being worn just below the knees, and calculated
to prevent the rupture of the hymen by any undue length of step or
violent exercise; hence a tinkling noise and a mincing step always
denoted a virgin. In Du Bisson&rsquo;s cases, however, virgins were out
of the question; they might be the victims of enforced continence, but a
Soudanese harem contains no virgins. On inquiry he learned that the very
peculiar and unmistakably painful gait was due to the fact that each
woman carried a bamboo stick, about eight inches in length, three inches
or more being inserted in the vagina so as to effectually fill the
opening, the balance projecting beyond, between the thighs of the
person; this bamboo stick, or guardian of female virtue, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
was held in place by a strap with a shield that covered the vulva, the
whole apparatus being strapped about the hips and waist, and the whole
being held in an undisplaceable position by a padlock. This was affixed
to the woman whenever she was allowed outside the harem grounds, being
placed in position by the eunuch, who carried the key at his girdle. In
such a harness virtue can be considered perfectly safe; even safe from
any mental depredation or revolution, as, with the plug causing such
uncomfortable sensations, it is perfectly safe to infer that the
imagination could not be seduced by any Don Juanic or other Byronic
unvirtuous revelry. The physical ills that this contrivance must cause
are necessarily without number, as the instrument is not as lightly
constructed as our modern stem pessaries; but to the Oriental who can
replace a woman at any time and who prizes the virginity, continence,
and chastity of his slaves, even if enforced, more than their health or
their lives, these are matters of secondary importance. In the Soudan
there are no divorce courts, hence the probable necessity of the
apparatus, and, as the woman is not obliged to wear it unless she
chooses to go out unattended, it can hardly be considered as a
compulsory barbarity. In the United States such a practice might do away
with considerable divorce proceedings.</p>

<p>Celsus gives a detailed description of the manner of infibulating as
practiced among the Romans. According to this authority, it was employed
by them on the youth attending the public schools, as well as upon the
actors, dancers, and choristers, who were sold to the directors of the
plays and spectacles. In the cabinet of the Roman College there are to
be seen two small statues representing two infibulated musicians, which
are remarkable for the excessive size of the ring and the leanness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of the persons to which they are attached. The mode of applying this
ring did not differ much from the usual method of preparing the ear for
pendants.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Among the Greek monks mentioned, the infibulation serves a manifold
purpose; it not only is a sure badge of chastity, but its weight and
size is very often increased so as to render it an instrument of
penitence, and considerable rivalry exists at times in this regard.
Virey notices that the Hindoo bonze, or fakir, at times submits to
infibulation at the same time that he takes his vows of eternal
chastity. This ring is at times enormous, being sometimes six inches in
diameter; so that it is a burden. These saints are held in great esteem
and veneration.</p>

<p>Nelaton, in the sixth volume of his &ldquo;Surgery,&rdquo; mentions the
case of a man who presented himself at Dupuytren&rsquo;s clinic with a
tumefied, thickened, and somewhat dilapidated and ulcerated prepuce;
this prepuce had worn a couple of golden padlocks for five years, a
woman having thus infibulated his organ.</p>

<p>In an elaborate work on the subject of circumcision,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
de Vanier du Havre relates, on the authority of M. Martin Flaccourt,
that with the Mad&eacute;casses the children are circumcised on the
eighth day after birth; and that in some portions of the country the
mother swallows the removed portion of the prepuce, while in others the
father loads the prepuce in some form of fire-arm, which is afterward
fired in the air. In the neighborhood of Djezan, in Arabia, as reported
by M. Fulgence Fresnel in the <i>Revue de Deux Mondes</i> of 1838, courtship
and matrimony are not so great social events as they are with our
society beaux. The occasion is probably considered social enough by the
rest of the invited guests, but it can hardly be called an agreeable

episode in the life of the groom. Those whose bashfulness prevents them
from contracting marriage in civilized communities can have the
consolation of knowing that in far-off Arabia, among the fierce
followers of the conquerors of Spain and of the Eastern Empire, they
have sympathizing fellow-sufferers whom the conventionalities of the
country deter from rushing into matrimony. In this region, circumcision
is performed on the adult at the time of his candidacy for matrimonial
bliss. A more inauspicious occasion could not possibly have been chosen,
unless as in another Mohammedan tribe, who circumcise the bridegroom on
the day after his marriage and sprinkle the blood that falls from the
cut onto the veil of the bride. The bride is present, and the victim is
handed over to what might be called the executioner of the holy office,
who proceeds to circumcise the victim in what might be called its utmost
degree of performance and barbarity. This attention does not stop at the
pendulous and loose prepuce. He devotes himself to the skin of the whole
organ; beginning at the prepuce he gradually works backward, removing
the whole skin of the penis&mdash;a flaying alive, and nothing more.
Should the victim betray any sign of weakness, or allow as much as a
sigh or groan to escape him, or even allow the muscles of the face to
betray the fact that he is not immensely enjoying the occasion, the
bride elect at once leaves him for good, saying that she does not wish a
woman for a husband. A large proportion of the male population annually
die from this operation. So that the Arabs of the Djezin can be likened
to those spiders who lose their life while in the act of
copulation,&mdash;the female making a dinner from off the
male,&mdash;only the spider is said to die a happy death, while that of
the Arab is one of misery.</p>

Margrave and Martyr have recorded a very peculiar practice common among
some South American tribes: A kind of a tube is fastened onto the
prepuce by means of threads of the <i>tacoynhaa</i>, the latter being the
bark of a certain kind of a tree. Cabras brought one of the natives, so
muzzled, to Lisbon, on the return from his first voyage. Some tribes
were observed to wear an apparatus like the old-fashioned
candle-extinguisher, the virile member having been forced into this
receptacle, which was strapped about the loins.</p>

<p>The travelers Spix and Martius found the practice of circumcision of
both sexes in the region of the upper Amazon River and among the Tuncas.
Squires mentions a curious custom of the aborigines of Nicaragua. They
wound the penis of their little sons and let some of the blood flow on
an ear of corn, which is divided among the assembled guests and eaten by
them with great ceremony.</p>

<p>On the fifth day after birth it is the custom among the Omaha Indians of
North America to christen the infant, the child being stripped and
spotted with a red pigment; considerable ceremony accompanies the
act.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Among the cannibals of Australia, Lumholtz<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
observed a practice that seems to have no analogue in the wide world,
either as an operation or in regard to its purposes. About ninety-five
per cent. of the children are subjected to the ordeal. This is no less
than the formation of an artificial hypospadias; this abnormality is
formed through the penis into the urethra, near its junction with the
scrotum; the wound is about an inch in length and is made with a flint
knife which serves for no other purpose; the edges of the wound are
burned with a hot stone, and the wound is subsequently kept open by the
introduction of a small piece of wood, which, on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
healing, leaves a permanent opening. These cannibals undoubtedly are
inspired by some Malthusian spirit which impels them thus to
functionally eunuchize themselves in one sense, as during copulation the
seminal discharge flies out backward through this opening, being thereby
a most effectual check on further procreation. By some, this practice
has been attributed to the unreliability of the seasons in regard to
food-production; but Lumholtz observes that where the practice is most
in vogue&mdash;among the tribes to the west of the Diamantina River and
west and north of the Gulf of Carpentaria&mdash;the food-supply is not
deficient, the region being full of rats, fish, and vegetables. All the
tribes are not subject to the practice of the operation at the same time
of life; in some, the hypospadias is not produced until in adult life
and after the person has married and has become the father of one or two
children, when he must submit to the requirements of the law; the
operation seems to be invested with some civil or religious
significance, as a palisade or stockade of trees is placed around the
place where it is performed. A native, aged about twenty years, informed
Lumholtz that the operation was performed because the blacks did not
like to hear the children cry about the camp, and, further, that they
were not desirous of having many children; this native had not yet
become a father and had not yet been subjected to the operation. The
natives were observed to be fat and in good physical condition.</p>

<p>There is something mysterious in this operation. It can easily be
conceived how circumcision might at times have been suggested by its
spontaneous and natural performance without any assistance from man.
Cullerier reports one case of partial circumcision <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
through the means of an accident happening to a painter. The man was at
work on a ladder, with a small bucket of paint hooked into one of the
rounds above him; through some means the bucket lost its hold and in
falling struck the penis on its dorsum with such force that the <ins
class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;prepuse&rsquo;.">prepuce</ins> was cut through on a parallel with the
corona of the glans for fully two-thirds of its circumference, the glans
slipping through the opening and gathering in a fleshy bunch underneath
the frenum. This man carried this abnormality for some years, when,
desiring to marry and seeing that this appendage would be as much of an
impediment as one of the huge rings worn by the Hindoo devotee, he
applied to Cullevier for advice, who promptly removed it with the
knife.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
The writer has seen three cases, during his practice, of spontaneous
circumcision, all resulting from phymosis as a secondary affection to
venereal disease. The first case occurred when he first entered into
practice; it was in a young, stout, and full-blooded man with a violent
gonorrh&oelig;a. There was much swelling and tumefaction of the whole
organ, which seemed to be very rebellious to all treatment. At one of
his morning visits he was horrified to observe a transverse, livid mark
at what seemed to be the middle of the organ; by noon this had gained
ground to the right and left and there was no mistaking that it meant
nothing less than mortification. Never having seen a case, the natural
uncomfortable conclusion was that, through some cause or other or the
natural result of excessive congestion, the man was about to lose
one-half of his organ; and Burnside at Fredericksburg was in no greater
state of suspense and uncertainty with the fate of the Army of the
Potomac on his hands than the writer must acknowledge he was with this
man and his organ apparently liquefying under <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his treatment. The surprise can be better imagined than described when,
on the following morning, the glans made its appearance safe and sound
out of its imprisonment, and at right angles with the organ there hung
the prepuce, thick and as large and as long as the penis itself,
inflammatory deposit and infiltration having brought it to that shape
and consistence; the glans became completely uncovered; the parts
gathered underneath, where, in the course of some weeks, they had shrunk
to the size of a walnut, which was afterward removed by the knife. In
this case, as in the other two cases observed, the corona was very
prominent and acted as an internal tourniquet by its upward pressure,
the line of demarkation being on the dorsum in the three cases noted.</p>

<p>That such cases would suggest circumcision is not only probable but
possible, as it would point out the manner of performing the operation;
but, in the cases of the Australian savages, who performed an artificial
hypospadias on themselves for a specific purpose, requiring a knowledge
of the anatomical relation of the parts as well as of their
physiological functions, it is hard to speculate how the operation was
first suggested or how it came at first to be performed. As a Malthusian
agent it is certainly an operation of the highest merit, and it should
be introduced, by all means, in the United States, where the wealth and
luxury in which the people dwell is fast drifting them toward the same
whirlpool that engulfed Rome, which was preceded by a dislike to have
children. Whenever the writer sees the poor an&aelig;mic, broken-down victim
of many miscarriages, he cannot help but feel that, if the laws of the
Damiantina River savages were enforced on their husbands, it would be a
blessing to the poor women <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
without materially injuring the husbands, who, in case of need of a
re-establishment of the functions of procreation, might be fitted with a
vulcanite plate for the occasion,&mdash;something like our cleft-palate
patients are supplied with a plate that enables them to articulate.</p>

<p>It was the custom among the Hottentots, when first discovered or known
to the whites, to remove one of their testicles. This was supposed to
enable them to run more swiftly and to be lighter-footed in the race.
The real reason, afterward found, was a mixture of pure humanitarianism
and Malthusianism boiled down to Hottentot ethics. With them a monorchid
was not supposed to beget twins; when twins are born in the family, the
mother generally smothers the female, if one happens to be such; if not,
then the feeblest of the two is sacrificed. In their migratory and
nomadic life the mother finds it impossible to either carry or care for
the two children. The male Hottentot, rather than have any avoidable
infanticide in his family, or that his wife should go through and suffer
the annoyance and pangs of an unnecessary and unprofitable pregnancy,
generously has one testicle removed; this is something that the ordinary
civilized white man would not do, even if his legitimate wife and all
his outside concubines were to have twins or triplets every nine months;
so that, even as strange as it may appear, civilization must need go to
the wild Bushmen in search of that grand old Quixotic chivalry that was
in ancient times always ready to sacrifice itself for the welfare of
woman.</p>

<p>The old Greek and Roman statues, representing the gods and athletes of
ancient Greece and Rome, are a puzzle to many, owing to the diminutive
and phimosed virile organ that the artists have attached to them. Galen
represents that the disuse of the organ by the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
athletes was the cause of its undeveloped form, and that as the organ
of these did not figure in the worship of Venus, or participate in the
festivals of Bacchus, but was used solely and simply for micturating
purposes, impotence was often the result, citing the case of a patient
who came to consult him for an obstinate priapism resulting from
venereal excess, who met, in his anteroom, an athlete who was being
treated for the opposite condition, due to the too rigid continence to
which he had been for years subjected. Acton does not believe that
continued continence has that effect, quoting Dr. Bergeret, who had long
been physician to a number of religious societies, as saying that he had
never seen serious troubles of the organs of generation in these
communities, which denotes that if they indulged in proper fasting and
prayer they were in the same condition of flaccid impotence as the
athlete in Galen&rsquo;s anteroom. Louis VII, of France, tried fasting
and prayer in connection with rigid continence, and, as a result, his
wife, Queen Eleonore, was divorced from him and married Henry II, of
England, who had not been continent. Hence, we see that the old
sculptors, whether wishing to represent Jupiter or Plato,
&AElig;sculapius or Mars, a strongly knit and muscular frame was
desired, an athlete, gladiator, or soldier being used as a model; the
small, puerile, funnel-prepuced organ belonged to all these muscular or
well-trained classes, was a natural appendage, as enforced continence
and the most absolute chastity was the rule, to enforce which they even
resorted to infibulation. This enforced continence often resulted in
impotence, even before the prime of life was passed, accompanied by an
inevitable atrophy of the male organ, with the resulting prepuce in the
shape in which it is found in a boy of from eight to twelve years,
precisely <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
as they are found on the statues. How faithful the sculptors and
artists were to nature and life in their representations can well be
imagined by a critical examination of the Apollo Belvidere, where the
difference of the scrotal position that exists between the right and
left testicles is carried out to the minutest anatomical detail. In our
age it is hard to conceive why their most masculine men should be
deified, and all their gods represented as the most perfect of bodily
development, while at the same time the finest physical specimens of
manhood were doomed to a life of the most rigorous continence. It is
also astonishing that all this should be done not from any principle or
consideration of morality or virtue, but simply as a means subservient
in producing at its maximum the highest degree of physical development
and endurance.</p>

<span class='sc sf75'>Attempts to Abolish Circumcision.</span></h2>

<p>Probably no rite or practice of a custom has been such a long-standing
bone of contention as circumcision; nor does the Sphynx surpass this
relic of bygone ages in mystery. From time immemorial its practice has
been the subject of disputes, and its literature finds oftentimes its
friends and foes ranged side by side. At one time a noted Israelite and
Voltaire, the scoffer of Judaism, may be consulted on the question as to
whether Israelite or Egyptian is entitled to priority as to its original
practice with a like answer; and, again, Christians are found who, after
a careful investigation, will accord this to the Israelites. In Rome,
the persecuted Hebrew was stopped on the street and compelled to show
the mark of circumcision, that he might be taxed, and in Turkish parts
the Christian was subjected to the same indignity to enable the
tax-gatherer to harvest the impost which he paid for his liberty of
conscience and not being circumcised. When the monkish missionaries of
the Catholic faith first entered Abyssinia, they were shocked to find
their converts insisting on their time-honored practice of circumcision;
and later, when the Propaganda sent its own missionaries, they were
scandalized to see Christians practicing what they looked upon as an
infidel rite; and nothing but the most earnest confession of faith, with
the assurance that the rite of circumcision was only a physical remedy,
and that in their conscience it in no wise possessed any religious
significance, and that neither did they, in any sense, hold it in any
connection with the sacrament of baptism, permitted these Abyssinians to
save themselves from excommunication.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Later still, when an Abyssinian bishop was present in Lisbon, the
clergy of the city refused him the right of celebrating the sacrifice of
the holy mass in the Cathedral of Lisbon, on the ground that he, having
been circumcised, was no better than a heretic. The Abyssinian
Christians still practice the rite at the present day.</p>

<p>The Turks, although very fanatical and greater proselyters than the
Christians of Rome, seem now and then to relax in favor of general
utility, as we find Bajazet II writing to the Pope, Alexander VI,
supplicating his Holiness to confer a cardinal&rsquo;s hat on the
Archbishop of Arles as a special favor to the Turkish emperor, as he
knew that the archbishop <i>had a secret leaning toward Mohammedanism</i>. As
the clergy of those days, from the Holy Father down, were more
politicians than followers of the humble Nazarene, the heaven of
Mohammed had probably more attractions for their taste than the ideal
Christian paradise, and it is possible that the good archbishop would
have submitted to a cardinal&rsquo;s hat and circumcision at the same
time to secure the good things of this world and of those in the world
to come. History also relates that his most Christian majesty, Henry
III, of France, as a relaxation to the interminable squabble between two
Christian religious factions which were rending France, and which in the
end cost him his life, actually wrote a letter to the Sultan, asking the
favor to be allowed to stand as godfather at the circumcision of his
son. When it is remembered that the godfather at a Turkish circumcision
has to make a strong profession of Moslem faith and the answers as
sponsor for the child, and must promise that the child will be faithful
to the Koran and Mohammed, it will be seen that, however much the lower
levels of humanity may quarrel over trifles, the heads of the people
easily <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
accommodated themselves to any existing circumstances. Friar Clemens
might as well have let such a liberal-minded monarch live, as any of the
existing churches could easily have got along with him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have the remarkable tenacity to custom and habit
in this regard, as exhibited by the Moslems, who, although having
neither ordinance nor authority for its performance, either in their
law, creed, or in any order from their prophet, still no more zealous
circumciser exists than the son of Islam, who exacts from all proselytes
the excision of the prepuce. Mohammed was circumcised in his boyhood,
and, although he did not order its performance to his followers, he did
not see fit to proscribe a custom so general to the Arabians, where the
greater development of the prepuce probably renders circumcision a
necessity. From the same reason it is easy to perceive why the rite has
found such general observance among the Africans, who are as noted for
long and leathery prepuces as for their slim shanks. One author, writing
in 1772, in a work entitled &ldquo;Philosophical Researches on the
Americans,&rdquo; treats the subject in a very intelligent manner. His
arguments are both ingenious and plausible. This author looks upon
circumcision as of purely climatic origin in its inceptive causes. From
a careful survey of the natural history of man in his general
distribution over the globe, he finds that circumcision may be said to
be restricted to within certain boundaries of latitude, equidistant on
both sides of the line. No circumcised people have ever inhabited
northern regions, and the bulk of the circumcised races are found within
certain climates. From this reasoning it is easy to see why the rite
should lose its standing under certain climatic conditions, unless
bolstered up by some religious significance, as it is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
equally easy to foresee why it should flourish elsewhere, even without
any religious backing or ordinance. It is well known that in Ethiopia
and the neighboring countries, excrescences and elongation of either the
prepuce or nymph&aelig; are as probable as the existence of an enlarged
thyroid gland or goitre among the inhabitants of some of the valleys of
Switzerland or of those of the Tyrol. According to the author of the
treatise just quoted, circumcision would be nothing more than a remedy
to repair the evils that a faulty construction of the human body
developed in certain climatic conditions.</p>

<p>With the Israelites it is observed as a religious rite, although they
are not strangers to the physical benefits that circumcision confers
upon them; the fact that even where no prepuce exists, as sometimes
happens, the circumciser nevertheless goes on with the rite, being
satisfied with drawing a few drops of blood from the skin near the
glans, stamps the operation essentially as being a religious rite.
Persecutions have signally failed to suppress its performance by those
of the Hebrew faith. Beginning with the decree of Antiochus, 167 <span class='sc lc'>B.C.</span>,
which consigned every Hebrew mother to death who dared to circumcise her
offspring, they have not ceased to suffer in defense of their rite.
Adrian, among other repressive measures, forbade circumcision; under
Antonine this edict was still enforced, but he afterward recalled it and
gave to the Hebrews the right of observing their religious rites. Marcus
Aurelius, however, revived the edict of Adrian. Heliogabalus, who
ascended the Roman throne in the year 218 <span class='sc lc'>A.D.</span>,
was himself circumcised. During the reign of Constantine all the laws
that interfered with Hebraic rites were renewed, with the addition that
any Hebrew who should circumcise a slave should suffer death. Under the
sway of Justinian, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in the sixth century, the persecutions against these people were so
oppressive that a Hebrew was not allowed to raise or educate his own
child in the faith of his fathers. In the seventh century, the augurs
having prophesied the ruin of the Roman Empire by a circumcised race to
the emperor Heraclius, the persecutions were renewed against these
unfortunate people. In this century, Hebrews refusing baptism suffered
banishment and confiscation of all their property; they were obliged to
renounce the Sabbath, circumcision, and all Hebraic rites if they wished
to remain. About this period the success of the Saracens induced
persecutions of the Hebrews in Spain, where their children were taken
away from them that they might be raised in the Christian religion. In
the fifteenth century they suffered the greatest persecution and
martyrdom at the hands of the Spanish Inquisition. The persecutions
above cited were national and governmental persecutions levelled
directly at the Jewish nation and creed; the persecutions that they
momentarily suffered at other times had no signification beyond the
exhibition of popular spite and fury, but those above cited were moves
calculated to extirpate the creed, if not the people, from off the face
of the globe. If repressive measures are of any avail, circumcision as
an Hebraic rite should now have no existence. Its present existence and
observance show a vitality that is simply phenomenal; its resistance and
apparent indestructibility would seem to stamp it as of divine origin.
No custom, habit, or rite has survived so many ages and so many
persecutions; other customs have died a natural death with time or want
of persecution, but circumcision, either in peace or in war, has held
its own, from the misty epochs of the stone age to the present.</p>

<p>There is something pathetic and soul-appealing in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
contemplating the early Christians forced to worship in the catacombs
of Rome, hunted like wild animals in their subterranean burrows, and
then given the choice of making offerings to the heathen gods or being
thrown into the arena as prey to wild beasts; so are we stirred when we
think of the Spanish Jew, who had made Spain his home for centuries,
being driven into exile in such droves that no country could receive
them; we see them perishing of hunger by the thousands on the African
coast, and dying of starvation on the quays of the ports of civilized
Italy. That many, through all these trials, were forced to embrace other
religions is not astonishing. In Spain apostacy was to no purpose, as
the Inquisition could not be expected to split hairs in regard to an
apostate Jew, when it sent the best of Gothic blood, raised in the
Catholic faith, to the <i>auto da f&eacute;</i> or the scaffold,&mdash;the
rack respecting neither faith nor profession that fell into its
clutches. In milder persecutions, however, he escaped by outwardly
conforming to the demands of his oppressors and history tells us of the
circumcisions secretly performed on the dead Jew, that the spirit of the
law of their fathers might be carried out.</p>

<p>In other cases, threatened exile, confiscation, or exorbitant taxation
drove them to adopt every possible expedient to eradicate the sign of
their Israelitism and make attempts to reform a prepuce. The first
attempts in this line were made during the reign of Antiochus, when a
number of Hebrews wished to become as the people about them who were not
persecuted&mdash;<i>fecerunt cibi pr&aelig;putia</i>. This is no easy operation, and in
later times by the aid of appliances, both in Rome and in Spain, they
undertook to cause the skin to recover the glans. Martial, in speaking
of the instrument used in Rome, a sort of a long funnel-shaped copper
tube in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
which the Hebrew carried his virile organ, terms it <i>Jud&aelig;m
Pondum</i>, the weight of which, by drawing down the skin, was supposed in
time to draw it down far enough to answer the purpose. The apostle Paul,
in his epistle to the Corinthians, refers to these practices when he
says, &ldquo;Was any one called being circumcised, let him not be
uncircumcised.&rdquo; The operation of reforming a prepuce, or of
obliterating the marks of circumcision, does not appear to have been a
success.</p>

<p>The writer had one experience that was interesting. On one occasion he
advised circumcision for the relief of a reflex nervous disease, in a
tall, athletic Austrian sailor from the Adriatic; although the nature of
the operation was explained to the man, he evidently did not appreciate
its full nature and importance until <ins class='corr'
title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed &lsquo;a
a&rsquo;.">a</ins> sweeping cut with a scalpel left the excised prepuce in the
operator&rsquo;s hand. Most Adriatic sailors have sailed up the
Bosphorus and are more or less familiar with both the Greek and Turkish
nations; the latter they despise with gusto, &ldquo;<i>porchi di
Turci</i>&rdquo; being the affectionate appellation they bestow on their
national neighbors. No sooner did he perceive the real condition of
affairs than he began to beat his head, saying that he was disgraced
forever, as he never would dare to associate with his countrymen again,
as he would be liable to be taken for a <i>porcho di Turco</i>; his frenzy
increased to such a pitch that to spare any unpleasantness it was deemed
advisable to replace the prepuce, which was done accordingly, the man
making a tolerable good recovery, as far as the grafted prepuce was
concerned. It required a secondary operation to overcome some
cicatricial contraction, and, on the whole, he had a very serviceable
prepuce; but, what was more to the point, it prevented his ever being
mistaken for a Turk.</p>

<p>What strange fancies have circled themselves about the subject of
generation or its organisms during the different stages of moral
civilization since the world has existed! The efforts in this regard
among different creeds have been something peculiar. Neither Mohammedans
nor Hebrews&mdash;both zealous circumcisers&mdash;ever went to the lengths reached
by Christian churches and their followers in some particulars concerning
this rite; this being especially strange when it is considered that the
new creed was the one that abolished the rite and through which the Jews
suffered such cruel and unjust persecutions. The early Christian Church
celebrated and continues to celebrate the Feast of Circumcision, and
history relates some strange events in connection with this
circumcision. Having abolished and repudiated the rite, it would seem
inconsistent that it should celebrate its performance on any occasion
and consider such an event sufficiently memorable that its occurrence
should excite the veneration of the church and be the means of exciting
the pious zeal of the faithful. The strangest events in this connection
are still more mysterious and incomprehensible, if not amusing, the only
excuse for the occurrence being the greedy thirst for relics of any and
all kinds that in the middle ages pervaded Europe.</p>

<p>At some remote period&mdash;in the thirteenth or fourteenth century&mdash;the
abbey church of Coulombs, in the diocese of Chartres, in France, became
possessed in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
some miraculous manner of the holy prepuce. This holy relic had the
power of rendering all the sterile women in the neighborhood
fruitful,&mdash;a virtue, we are told, which filled the benevolent monks
of the abbey with a pardonable amount of pride. It had the additional
virtue of inducing a subsequent easy delivery, which also added to the
reputation and pardonable vanity of the good monks. This last virtue,
however, we are told, came near causing the loss to the abbey of this
inestimable prize, for, as a French writer observes, a too great
reputation is at times an unlucky possession; at any rate, the royal
spouse of good and valiant King Henry V&mdash;he of Agincourt, whom
England waded up to its knees in the sea at Dover to meet on his return
from that campaign&mdash;had followed the example of all good dames and
was about to give England an heir. Henry then governed a good part of
France. Having heard of the wonderful efficacy of the relic of Coulombs,
he early one morning threw the good monks into consternation by the
arrival at the convent gate of a duly equipped herald and messenger from
his kingship, asking for the loan of the relic with about as much
ceremony as Mrs. Jones would ask for the loan of a flat-iron or saucepan
from her neighbor, Mrs. Smith. The queen, Catherine of France, was of
their own country and Henry was too powerful to be put off or refused;
there was no room for evasion, as the holy prepuce could not be
duplicated; so the poor monks with the greatest reluctance parted with
their precious relic, entrusting it into the hands of the royal envoy,
which wended its way to London, where it in due time, being touched by
the queen, insured a safe delivery. Honest Henry then returned the relic
to France; but so great was its reputation that royalty caused a special
sanctuary to be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
erected for its reception, and a full period of twenty-five years
occurred before the monks of Coulombs again regained possession of their
prize, during which period the population of the neighborhood must have
suffered from the natural increase of sterility and the physicians must
have reaped a rich harvest owing to the increased difficulty and
complications of labor induced by the absence of the relic. On its
return, the relic was found to have lost none of its virtues, and the
good people and monks were all correspondingly made happy; in 1870, when
the writer was in France, it was still working its miracles. Balzac
found ample facts to found his famous &ldquo;Droll Stories&rdquo;
without straining his imagination.</p>

<p>So great an attraction was not to go without attempted rivalry or
imitators; hence we find in the &ldquo;Dictionary of Moreri,&rdquo;
edition of 1715, in the third volume, at page 108, that several other
establishments claim the honor of a like relic,&mdash;namely, the Cathedral
of Puy, in Velay; the collegial church of Antwerp; the Abbey of our
Saviour, of Charroux; and the Church of St. John Lateran, in Rome. All
of these have had very adventurous histories. The Abbey of Charroux was
founded by Charlemagne in 788, and among the relics with which that
monarch endowed the abbey the principal one was a fragment of the holy
prepuce. This abbey enjoyed great reputation, and indulgences were
granted by Papal bull to all those who assisted at the adoration of the
relics. In the internecine wars of the sixteenth century the abbey fell
into the hands of the godless and heretical Huguenots and the holy relic
disappeared. In 1856, while some workmen were at work demolishing an
ancient wall on the abbey site, they discovered some relic cases. The
bishop was at once notified, who immediately proceeded to investigate,
when, lo and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
behold! there, sure enough, was a piece of desiccated flesh, with marks
of coagulated blood; nothing more or less than the lost
prepuce&mdash;long lost, but now found. It was placed in charge of the
Ursuline Sisterhood, where it has remained ever since undisturbed,
except by a controversy in regard to the propriety of the relic, in
which the good bishop ambled about in the most ambiguous manner, the
only clearly defined portion of his dissertation being the one wherein
he laments &ldquo;the decadence of that truly Christian spirit which
animated the laity of the middle ages with a radiant zeal. A piety also
pervaded those gentle Christians of former times, who were possessed of
a religious instruction which determined for them the tenets of the
creed and its practices,&mdash;a happy state or condition of affairs,
which prevented the intelligence of the faithful from wandering into the
sloughs of unprofitable skepticism.&rdquo; This settled the question as
to the propriety of the prepuce being converted into a miracle-working
relic; at least, as far as the good bishop was concerned.</p>

<p>It would be an injustice not to mention the other shrines in detail
after the prominence that has been given to the abbeys of Coulombs and
Charroux; so the history of another will be given. We are not told just
how the Church of St. John Lateran in Rome first became possessed of
<i>its</i> holy prepuce, but it nevertheless had one; also the only authentic
one in existence, like all the others. It disappeared at one of the
periodical sackings that Rome has repeatedly suffered at the hands of
Goth, Vandal, or Christian. This time it was the soldiery of the eldest
son of the church&mdash;- Charles V&mdash;who did the sacking; it was in the year
1527, a soldier&mdash;probably some impious, heathenish mercenary&mdash;broke into
the holy sanctuary of the church and stole therefrom <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the box that contained the holy relics, among them the holy prepuce.
These impious wretches, as a rule, came to grief in short order; hence
we are told that this mercenary and sacrilegious soldier was compelled
to secrete his box, when only a short distance from Rome, where the box
remains and the mercenary wretch disappears, probably carried off bodily
by the devil, as he deserved. Thirty years afterward the box is
discovered by a priest, who, ignorant of its contents, carries it to the
lady on whose domain it was found. On being opened it was found to
contain a piece of the anatomy of Saint Valentine, the lower jaw of
Saint Martha, with one tooth still in place, and a small package upon
which the name of the Saviour was inscribed. The lady picked up the
package, when immediately the most fragrant odor pervaded the apartment,
being exhaled by the miraculous packet, while the hand that held it was
seen perceptibly to swell and stiffen; investigation proved it to be the
holy prepuce stolen by the miscreant mercenary from St. John Lateran. It
is related that in 1559, a canon of the church of St. John Lateran,
impelled by a worldly curiosity untempered by piety, undertook to make a
critical examination of this relic, in the process of which, to better
satisfy himself, he had the indiscretion to break off a small piece;
instantly the most dreadful tempest broke over the place, followed by
crashing peals of thunder and blinding flashes of lightning; then a
sudden darkness covered the country, and the luckless priest and his
assistants fell flat on their sacerdotal noses, feeling that their last
hour had arrived.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Wonderful and miraculous cures are performed at these shrines, and some
of the cures are of a nature that would baffle the intelligence of the
most learned <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
mind to ascertain the intricate and devious way that nature must at
times journey to accomplish some of these changes. The writer well
remembers seeing, in the Church of Corpus Christi, in Turin,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
a long hall, covered, from marble pavement to ceiling, with votive
tablets, after the manner inaugurated in the old temples of Greece.
Modern votaries have the advantage of being able to record their cure,
safe venture or escape from peril, by means of faithful representation
of the event in painting or drawing, as the material and art is more
common now than in the days of ancient Greece, who recorded its cures by
simple inscription in laconic terms. Modern medicine labors under the
disadvantage of presuming that the people are endowed with an
intelligence that was unknown to ancient or medi&aelig;val people, when,
in fact, the people are as credulous and as subject to imposition as
they were in the earlier centuries of the present era. With all its
supposed superior intelligence, there is no fatter pasture for quacks
and impostors than that presented by the people of the United States.
Whenever I see the poor, intelligent, broad-minded physician struggling
along, barely able to procure for himself the necessaries required to
maintain himself with proper books and appliances, while the itinerant
quack or dogmatic practitioner rolls in undeserved affluence, I question
the wisdom of our ethical code. Braddock, at the Monongahela, scorned to
have his regulars, who had fought under Marlborough and Eugene, break
ranks before a lot of breech-clouted savages, and take shelter that the
nature of the ground and the trees could afford, thinking it an unfit
action for men who had faced the veterans of Louis XIV on many a
hard-fought European field. I sometimes think that if <i>our</i> regulars
were, for only a season, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to follow the example of the provincial militia at that battle, it
would be better for the country, the people, science, and last, but not
the least, for the profession. The theory that we should not counsel
with quacks is altogether mischievous and fallacious, although right and
rigidly orthodox in its intent; were we to counsel and meet these
gentry, we should expose their ignorance and assumption, and we should
not be exposed to the charge of jealousy and of fear to meet them in
consultation. I remember on one occasion a client went to a lawyer for
advice as to how he might dispossess some parties who had some adverse
claim to some property which he owned, after due deliberation and a
protracted siege of the house, in the vain hope of gaining admittance;
the lawyer advised his client to go and nail up all exits and fasten
them in, which had the effect of driving them out. So with our
profession&mdash;we should not neglect an opportunity of meeting a quack
in consultation, regardless of the nature of the case; it is the only
way to nail them up; as it is, we have simply chained up the
shepherd-dog and given the wolves full play.</p>

<p>The French Guards at Fontenoy, who out of courtesy refused to fire first
on the English, may have been very ethical and chivalrous, but they were
very foolish, as the English discharge nearly swept them from the field,
and but for the Irish Brigade, who knew no ethics, Louis XV would in all
likelihood have followed the example of King John, who, after Crecy,
visited England for a season. A disregard of ethics gave Copenhagen to
Lord Nelson, who insisted on looking at Admiral Parker&rsquo;s signal to
withdraw from action with his sightless eye, which could not see it. A
fear of disregarding ethics lost to Grouchy the chance of assisting
Napoleon at Waterloo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
In our strife against ignorance and quackery the profession should
follow the general plan of action usually adopted by Lord
Nelson&mdash;lie alongside of whom you can and sink or capture your
enemy; let each man do his duty; never mind any general plan. A reverse
to this mode of fighting invariably lost the battle to the French and
Spaniards, who were, as a rule, all tied up in ethical red tape. Our
profession is broad, intelligent, and fearless; we do not profess any
exclusive dogma, and should not, therefore, exclude persons; as a large
ship throws its grappling-irons on to its adversary, we should always
seek an opportunity to meet these gentry when practicable. As it is, we
have placed them on the vantage-ground of appearing as being persecuted;
our ethics need circumcising in this regard, and the prepuce of
exclusion should be buried in the sands of the desert.</p>

<p>Moreover, we often are apt to learn something from even the most
ignorant of these men. Rush investigated the nature of a cancer-cure by
not refusing to meet and talk with one of this kind;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Fothergill learned from an old, unlicensed practitioner that there was a
knowledge important to the physician beyond that picked up in the
pathological laboratory or the study of microscopy; and that the
practiced eye of an otherwise unlearned man could detect that there were
general physical signs that negatived the unfavorable prognosis
suggested by the presence of tube-casts.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
It is related of Sir Isaac Newton, that while riding homeward one day,
the weather being clear and cloudless, in passing a herder he was warned
to ride fast or the shower would wet him. Sir Isaac looked upon the man
as demented, and rode on, not, however, without being caught in a
drenching shower. Not being able to account for the source of
information through which the rustic had gained his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
knowledge, he rode back, wet as he was, to learn something. &ldquo;My
cow,&rdquo; answered the man, &ldquo;always twists her tail in a certain
way just before a rain, your Worship, and she so twisted it just before
I saw you.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Although twisting cow-tails do not figure in his &ldquo;Principia,&rdquo;
it is very probable that such a lesson was not without its remote
effects on a mind like Newton&rsquo;s. A spider taught a lesson to one
of Scotland&rsquo;s kings; so that one man may learn something from
another.</p>

<p>Professor Letenneur, of the Medical School of Nantes, in his
&ldquo;Causerie &agrave; propos de la Circoncision,&rdquo; mentions that the
Convent of Saint Corneille, in Compi&egrave;gne, claims to possess the
identical instrument with which the Holy Circumcision was performed.
Such a holy relic must have been unusually potential in performing many
miracles.</p>

<p>In this connection it will not be amiss to notice the lapping over that
the old phallic worship and idea has made on the new religions. It is
also as interesting to observe how the human mind still leans toward
observances and ideas which are believed to belong to a solely pagan
people. Hargrave Jennings, in a chapter devoted to phallic worship among
the ancient Gauls, gives many interesting and curious examples, the
first example that he notices being that of Saint Foutin (from whom the
very expressive French word &ldquo;<i>foutre</i>&rdquo; is taken). Foutin was
the first Christian bishop of Lyons, and after his death, so intimately
was priapic worship intermingled with the religion or theology of the
Gauls, that somehow the memory of St. Foutin and the old, dethroned
Priapus became commingled, and finally the former was unconsciously made
to take the place of the latter. St. Foutin was immensely popular. He
was believed to have a wonderful influence in restoring fertility
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to barren women and vigor and virility to impotent men. It is related
that, in the church at Varages, in Provence, to such a degree of
reputation had the shrine of this saint risen, it was customary for the
afflicted to make a wax image of their impotent and flaccid organ, which
was deposited on the shrine. On windy days the beadle and sexton were
kept busy in picking up these imitations of decrepit and penitent male
members from the floor, whither the wind wafted them, much to the
annoyance and disturbance of the female portions of the congregation,
whose devotions are said to have been sadly interfered with. At a church
in Embrun there was a large phallus, which was said to be a relic of St.
Foutin. The worshippers were in the habit of offering wine to this
deity,&mdash;after the manner of the early Pagans,&mdash;the wine being
poured over the head of the organ and caught underneath in a sacred
vessel. This was then called &ldquo;holy vinegar,&rdquo; and was
believed to be an efficacious remedy in cases of sterility, impotence,
or want of virility.</p>

<p>Near the city of Bourges, at Bourg Dieu, there existed, during the Roman
occupation of Gaul, an old priapic statue, which was worshipped by the
surrounding country. The veneration in which it was held and the
miracles with which it was accredited made it impolitic as well as
impossible for the early missionaries and monks to remove it; it would
have created too much opposition. It was therefore allowed to remain,
but gradually changed into a saint,&mdash;St. Guerluchon,&mdash;which, however,
did not detract any from its former merit or reputation. Sterile women
flocked to the shrine, and pilgrimages and a set number of days of
devotion to this saint were in order. Scrapings from this statue infused
in water were said to make a miraculous drink <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
which insured conception. Similar shrines to this same saint were
erected at other places, and we are told that the good monks, who must
have had an intense and lively interest in seeing that the population
was increased, were kept busy supplying the statues with new members, as
the women scraped away so industriously, either to prepare a drink for
themselves or for their husbands, that a phallus did not last long. At
one of these shrines, so onerous became the industry of replacing a new
phallus to the saint, that the good monks placed an apron over the
organ, informing the good women that thereafter a simple contemplation
of the sacred organ would be sufficient; and a special monk was detailed
to take special charge of this apron, which was only to be lifted in
special cases of sterility. By this innovation the good monks stole a
march on their brothers in like shrines in other localities, such as
those of St. Gilles, in Brittany, or St. Rene, in Anjou, where the
old-fashioned scraping and replacing still was in vogue. Near the
seaport town of Brest, in Brittany, at the shrine of St. Guignole, the
monks adopted a new expedient. They bored a hole through the statue,
through which a phallus was made to project horizontally; as fast as the
devotees scraped away in front the good monks as industriously pushed
forward the wooden peg that formed the phallus, so that it gave the
member the miraculous appearance of growing out as fast as scraped off,
which greatly added to its reputation and efficacy. The shrine continued
in great vigor until the middle of the last century. Delaure mentions a
similar shrine at Puy, also in France, which existed up to the outbreak
of the French Revolution. The scrapings in this case were immersed in
wine, and the guardians of the statue saw to it that no amount of paring
or scraping should remove <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
from the saint any of that appearance of vigor or virility which his
great reputation demanded, this being done by a similar procedure as
followed at the church near Brest, one of the attendants having been
sent to investigate into the marvelous growth of the Brest phallus.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>History of Emasculation, Castration, and Eunuchism</span>.</h2>

<p>For the earliest records in regard to emasculation we must go back to
mythological relations. In the old legendary lore of ancient Scandinavia
or of Germany, the loves and hatreds of their semi-mythological heroes
and heroines space over many romantic incidents before reaching a
culmination. The swiftly flowing Rhine, with its precipitous banks,
eddies, and rapids; the broad and more majestic Danube or Elb; the broad
meadows and Druidical groves on its hilly slopes and stretches of dark
and gloomy forest,&mdash;all conspired to people the fancy with elfs, gnomes,
fairies, and goblins, who were more or less intermingled in all the
episodes that engaged their semi-mythological heroes. This helped to
fill in all their deeds with entertaining incidents; their halls and
castles were made necessary accessories by the rigors of the climate, as
well as were the beery feasts and carousals with the inspiration of
monotonous song also rendered necessaries by the same element; hence, we
have various incidents, either entertaining or exciting, connected with
their legendary tales, acting like periods of intermission between their
love scenes, spites, hatreds, murders, and general cremations. From such
material and such opportunities it was comparatively easy for Wagner to
construct the thrilling and interesting incidents that compose his opera
on the legend of the Nibelungenlied.</p>

<p>The Grecian landscape and topography does not permit of such richness of
romantic incidents or details, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
any more than the love-making of the unfortunate spider who is devoured
by his spidery Cleopatra at the end of his first sexual embrace could
furnish any incidents for one of Amelie Rives&rsquo;s spirited novels;
so that neither minstrel nor bard have recorded the details of the first
emasculating tragedy, which from all accounts was a kind of an Olympian
Donnybrook-fair sort of a paricidal-ending tragedy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Homer was not there to describe the event, or we might
have had a Wagnerian opera with its Plutonic music to illustrate all its
incidents; or even a Virgil could have made it into interesting verses;
but, as it is, we must content ourselves with the laconic recitals that
have been handed down by tradition, and, as all the Greek performances
of those days were marked by an intense decisiveness, with an utter lack
of circumlocution, it is probable that there was not much to relate
beyond the bare facts.</p>

<p>In Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biographies and
Mythology&rdquo; we find it related that Uranos, or C&oelig;lus, was the
progenitor of all the Grecian gods. His first children were the
Centimanes; his next progeny were the Cyclops, who were imprisoned in
Tartarus because of their great strength. This so angered their mother,
G&auml;a, that she incited her next-born children, the Titans, into a
rebellion against their father, Uranos. In the general turmoil that
followed Uranos was deposed, and, so that he would be incapable of
begetting any more children, Saturnus, the youngest of his sons, with a
sickle made from a bright diamond, successfully emasculated poor old
Uranos. The records are not clear whether the operation only included
the penis, or the scrotum and contents, or whether, like the Turkish or
Chinese <i>taill&egrave; &agrave; fleur de ventre</i>, Saturnus made a clean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
sweep of all the genitals; it is probable that he did, however, as the
members fell into the sea, and in the foam caused by the commotion from
their contact with the element Venus was born. Meanwhile, the blood that
dripped from the wounded surface caused the Giants, the Furies, and the
Melian nymphs to spring into life. Uranos is also represented as being
the first king of Atlantis; so that the first eunuch was a god and a
king, more unfortunate than any of Doran&rsquo;s heroes, in his
&ldquo;Monarchs Retired from Business,&rdquo; because he was more
effectually retired from business than any monarch that Doran records.</p>

<p>After this the practice seems to have been adopted in a general way; and
the fact that the future proceedings of men and things on earth do not
much interest these unfortunate members of society in any great degree,
interest in worldly affairs and testicles seemingly having been as
intimately connected in those early and remote days as with us of the
present, it very naturally followed that this disinterestedness, as well
as the docility and pliability which emasculation engenders, first
suggested their use as servants or in position of trust, as a eunuch,
having no incentive either to run away or to embezzle, would naturally
be a valued and trusted servant. In the days of eunuchism there were no
defaulting bank, city, or county cashiers,&mdash;a circumstance which would
suggest that such a condition should form one of the qualifications for
eligibility to such offices, the very opposition to any such proposal
that the class would make showing in itself the benefits that would
follow such an innovation, as it would show that the class is not
possessed with that total spirit of abnegation requisite in the
guardians of public funds. The requirement might be extended to
bank-presidents with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
benefit, if some Cincinnati episodes are any criterion. It is safe to
assume that the bank that could advertise, in connection with its
attractive quarterly or semi-annual statement, that the president and
cashier were properly attested and vouched-for eunuchs would find in the
public such a recognition of the fitness of things that the patronage it
would receive would soon compel other banks to follow the example. The
procedure might, with national benefit, be extended as an ordeal to our
legislators at the national capitol, as it would do away with the
particular influential lobby so graphically described in Mark
Twain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gilded Age.&rdquo; These things or ideas are merely
thrown out as suggestions to be used by those who write those
interesting articles in the <i>Forum</i>, or the <i>North American</i> or
<i>Fortnightly Reviews</i>, on government and social reforms, as a perusal of
the many articles written in that direction will convince any one that,
from a practical psychological view of the matter, they are sadly
deficient. To make those articles effective the reflex impressions made
by the animal on the psychological and moral nature of man should not be
neglected.</p>

<p>Semiramis, whose beauty and many accomplishments, assisted by the
murders of several of her husbands by the hand of the succeeding one,
had this subject in hand in a far more practical manner than it is
generally forced on the understanding; hence we see that she was the
first to introduce the use of eunuchs in the capacity of servants as
well as in official positions in and about the palace, as well as
trusting some of the positions of the highest importance to the class.
From her epoch, eunuchism has become an inseparable attendant on
Oriental despotism, and has so continued to the present day. Like yellow
fever, phthisis, and some diseases, as well as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
many other social afflictions and customs, eunuchism does not seem to
flourish beyond certain degrees of north and south latitudes,&mdash;a
fact that probably assisted Montesquieu to arrive at the conclusion that
climate was a powerful factor in all things.</p>

<p>Bergmann, of Strasburg, quotes the ancient traditions, wherein it is
stated that man was taught the art of castration by the brute creation.
The hyena is cited as having so instructed man by the habit it exhibited
of castrating its infant males in removing the testicles with its teeth,
the habit being instigated by a jealousy, for fear of future competition
in the exercise of the procreative act on the part of the young males.
Another tradition attributes its origin to the castor. Bergmann here
traces out the etymological relation existing between the name of the
operation and that of the animal with that of a Greek verb that forms
the root of <i>castrum</i>, or camp; <i>casa</i>, or house; <i>castigare</i>, to
arrange; from whence also is traced <i>cosmos</i>, the world; <i>kastorio</i>, the
Greek for wishing to build, and the Latin <i>kasturio</i> having the same
relative but a more imperative signification; <i>kastor</i>, signifying as
loving to build; <i>castitiator</i>, Latin for architect, and <i>casticheur</i>,
old French for constructor. The tale or tradition in regard to the
self-mutilation inflicted by the castor is traced to the Arabian
merchants who purchased the castoreum, which was imported from the
shores of the Persian Gulf and from India. It was called, also, by the
Arabs, <i>chuzyalu-l-bahhr</i>, or testicles from beyond the sea; or, in
French, <i>testicules d&rsquo;outre mer</i>. These terms and the tradition
that the castor on being pursued, knowing the reason of the chase, was
in the habit of tearing out his testicles and throwing them at his
pursuers, were invented by these merchants to heighten the price and
value of the article <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
intrinsically, as well as to make it more interesting by this peculiar
individuality of adventure. The Latins, believing and adopting the
tradition as a matter of fact, coined the word <i>castorare</i>, or doing
like the castor. Bergmann uses in this connection a number of terms in
French to denote different forms or degrees of this mutilation which
have no equivalents in English,&mdash;for instance, <i>chatrure</i>, as
applied to animals, making also a distinctive difference between the
meaning of the French words <i>castration</i> and <i>chatrement</i>. Bergmann is a
decided evolutionist as regards circumcision being evolved from prior
forms of physical mutilation, as will be more fully explained in the
next chapter; the shaving of the head of a conquered people by the
Hindoos, or the shearing the royal locks of the ancient Frankish kings;
the blinding of one eye of their slaves by the old Scythians, or
crippling one foot by the division of a tendon in a captive by the
Goths, he considers as on the same line with the idea that led to
castration, the different forms of eunuchism, and circumcision.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>From a purely materialistic and utilitarian view of the subject, he
observes that what we call moral progress and civilization owe their
advancement more to material interest and cold, selfish calculation than
to any development of the humanitarian sentiments, and that neither
morality nor justice has much to do with it. The evolution of the slave
and the marks inflicted upon him by his fellow humans are the most
emphatic evidences of the justness of the above proposition. The study
of the subject is equally interesting when considered in connection with
the evolutions of the Christian Church. In its divergence from Judaism
and its beneficent laws, both social and moral, the Christian Church was
but illy fit to cope with its persecutors of Pagan <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
tendencies, or to enforce an unwritten law or code of morality or
hygiene among an idolatrous, barbarous, and ignorant population such as
it had to encounter. To its professors, the formation of that monachism
which has been so much misunderstood and abused was but an inevitable
condition.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
These men had not the steady compass to guide them in the path that was
possessed by the Jewish people. The martyrdom of Christ and many of his
apostles, and the teachings of the early church, pointed to physical
denials, castigations, humiliations, and sufferings as the only way to
salvation; all pleasures were sin and all denials and pain were looked
upon as steps to heaven. The climate pointed to sexual indulgence as the
sum of all happiness, as can readily be inferred from the Mohammedan
idea of heaven; so, with the early Christians who were born in the same
climates, the denials of sexual pleasures were looked upon as the most
acceptable offering that man could make to the Deity. Continence,
celibacy, infibulation, and even castration were the conditions looked
upon by many of these men as the only means of living a life on earth
that would grant them an eternal life in the next. This view of the
situation peopled the deserts with a lot of men dwelling in caves and in
huts, living on such a scarce diet that they barely existed. That many
went insane, and in their frenzy died while roaming in these solitudes,
we have ample evidence. The tortures and impositions of the Pagan rulers
also drove many to this life or death.</p>

<p>Religious mania has caused many cases of self-mutilation, either to
escape continued promptings and desires, or simply from a resulting
species of insanity. Of the first, Sernin<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
reported to the Medical Society of Paris the case of a young priest who
had castrated <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
himself with the blade of a pair of scissors, and who nearly lost his
life with the subsequent h&aelig;morrhage. The writer saw an analogous
case on board an American war-vessel, of which Dr. Lyon was surgeon, in
the harbor of Havre, in the spring of 1871, the subject being the
ship&rsquo;s cobbler, a religious fanatic, who was driven insane by
self-imposed continence. We are not surprised, from the lack of
intelligence of the times, the extreme but undefined views as to
religion that then ruled men, that self-imposed castration should have
been sanely considered and carried into effect by Origines and his
monks. The Cybelian priesthood had formerly set the example in their
Pagan worship, and when we are told that the monks of Mount Athos
accused the monks of the convent of a neighboring island with falling
away from grace, because they allowed <i>hens</i> to be kept within the
convent inclosure, we may well believe that Origines and his monks felt
that they were gradually ascending in grace when they submitted to this
sacrifice. As strange as it may sound, self-castration is still
practiced by the Skoptsy, a religious sect in Russia. In justice to the
Church, however, it must be said that she neither asked for nor did she
sanction these performances, although she was not quick enough in
asserting that she recognized the same law in regard to her presbytery
that controlled that of the Hebraic priesthood.</p>

<p>Eunuchism presents many contradictory conditions; eunuchs have not
always been the fat and sleek attendants on Oriental harems as tradition
and custom places them or would have us believe; neither does the loss
of virility, in a procreative sense, seem to have always robbed them of
their virility in other senses, as we find eunuchs holding the highest
offices in the State under <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the reigns of Alexander, the Ptolemys, Lysimachus, Mithrades, Nero, and
Arcadius. The eunuch Aristonikos, under one of the Ptolemys, and
another, Narces, under Justinian, led the armies of their sovereigns.
These are, however, exceptional cases; as a rule, the result is as we
observe in the domestic animals,&mdash;loss of spirit, vim, and
ambition. The Church recognized this result, and, while the Hebraic law
excluded eunuchs from participating in the priesthood as being imperfect
and unclean, the Church reproached Origines and his monks and excluded
eunuchs from its presbytery on the ground that such beings lack the
moral and physical energy requisite in a calling that is supposed to
guide or lead men; moreover, there are many reasons for doubting that
the ministers of state and the generals of the reigns above mentioned
were actually eunuchs in the full acceptance of the word. Among the
ancients there were several methods of performing the operations that
made the eunuchs; some were more effectual than others. From the removal
of <i>all</i> the genitals, or the penis alone, or the scrotum and testicles,
or removing only the testicles, down to compression or to distorting the
spermatic vessels, or, as in the case of the Scythians, who often became
eunuchs from bareback riding, as Hammond describes a eunuchism
manufactured by our southwestern Indians of New Mexico and Arizona, are
performances that left many degrees of eunuchism; as we find some
eunuchs that not only contracted marriage, but engendered children.
Voltaire mentions Kislav-aga, of Constantinople, a eunuch <i>&agrave;
outrance</i>, with neither penis, scrotum, nor anything, who owned a large
and select harem. Montesquieu, in his &ldquo;Persian Letters,&rdquo;
admits this class of marriages as being practiced, but doubts the
resulting conjugal felicity, especially <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
on the part of the wife. Potiphar&rsquo;s wife was one of these
unfortunate wives; no wonder that she tore Joseph&rsquo;s cloak in her
desire. Juvenal mentions that some eunuchs were held in high esteem by
the Roman matrons; it possibly could have been some of this kind of a
eunuch that led armies or ruled in the palaces. Among the sultans and
Oriental potentates those who had every exterior evidence of virility
removed, so as to be obliged to micturate through the means of a
catheter, were considered the safest guards, as well as they were the
highest-priced eunuchs, for in their manufacture fully 75 per cent. of
those operated upon died as a result. It is related that the Caribs made
eunuchs of their prisoners of war on the same principle that caponizing
is resorted to for our kitchens,&mdash;the prisoners were easier to
fatten and were more tender when cooked. The Italians allowed their
children to be eunuchized for chorister purposes in church services,
their soprano voices after this treatment being simply perfect. It was
considered that, in the year prior to the papal ordinance of Pope
Clement XVI forbidding the practice or the employment of eunuchs in
choirs, four thousand boys, mostly in the neighborhood of Rome, were
castrated for chorister purposes.</p>

<p>In China eunuchs were in use during the reign of the Emperor Yen-Wang,
in 781 <span class='sc lc'>B.C.</span> The Chinese make their eunuchs by a complete ablation of all
genitals. In India the followers of Brahma never placed their women in
charge of eunuchs. In Italy it was customary to emasculate boys that
they might grow up with the faculty of taking the female parts in
comedies, their voices thereby assimilating to that of the other sex,
this being on the same principle that the <i>basso-profundos</i> were
infibulated that they might retain their bass.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Eunuchism resulting from an operation owing to disease has at times
given queer and unlooked-for results, as, for instance, in the case of
the old man that Sprengle mentions, in whom castration did not remove an
inordinate sexual desire. Sir Astley Cooper mentions a case in his
&ldquo;Diseases of the Testes&rdquo; that is somewhat unique. After
castration Sir Astley&rsquo;s patient showed the following results:
&ldquo;For nearly the first twelve months he stated that he had
emissions <i>in coitu</i>, or that he had the sensations of emission; that
then he had erections and coitus at distant intervals, but without the
sensation of emission. After two years he had excretions very rarely and
very imperfectly, and they generally ceased immediately upon the attempt
at coitus. Ten years after the operation he said he had during the past
year been only once connected. Twenty-eight years after the operation he
stated that for years he had seldom any excretion, and then that it was
imperfect.&rdquo; In regard to the mortality from castration done in a
professional manner and for disease, Curling, in his work on
&ldquo;Diseases of the Testis,&rdquo; observes that he saw or performed
some thirty operations without a death, and that in a table of like
operations performed at the H&ocirc;tel Dieu, in Paris, it appeared that the
mortality was one in four and a quarter.</p>

<p>J. Royes Bell, in the sixth volume of the &ldquo;International
Encyclop&aelig;dia of Surgery,&rdquo; has the following in regard to the
practice among the Mohammedans in India: &ldquo;Young boys are brought
from their parents, and the entire genitals are removed with a sharp
razor. The bleeding is treated by the application of herbs and hot
poultices; h&aelig;morrhage kills half the victims, and at times brings
the perpetrators of the vile proceeding within the clutches of the law.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>&rdquo;
The <i>taill&egrave; &agrave; fleur de ventre</i> of the Chinese is a somewhat primitive
procedure. According to Dr. Morache, in his account of China in the
&ldquo;Dic. Ency. des Sciences M&eacute;dicales,&rdquo; the operation is as
follows: &ldquo;The patient, be he adult or child, is, previous to the
operation, well fed for some time. He is then put in a hot water bath.
Pressure is exercised on the penis and testes, in order to dull
sensibility. The two organs are compressed into one packet, the whole
encircled with a silk band, regularly applied from the extremity to the
base, until the parts have the appearance of a long sausage. The
operator now takes a sharp knife, and with one cut removes the organ
from the pubis; an assistant immediately applies to the wound a handful
of styptic powder, composed of odoriferous raisins, alum, and dried
puffball powder (boletus-powder). The assistant continues the
compression till h&aelig;morrhage ceases, adding fresh supplies of the
astringent powders; a bandage is added and the patient left to himself.
Subsequent h&aelig;morrhage rarely occurs, but obliteration of the canal of
the urethra is to be dreaded. If at the end of the third or fourth day
the patient does not make water, his life is despaired of. In children
the operation succeeds in two out of three cases; in adults, in one-half
less. Poverty is the cause which induces adults to allow themselves to
be thus mutilated. It is said to be difficult to distinguish these last
from ordinary Chinese men. Adult-made eunuchs are much sought after, as
they present all the attributes of virility without any of its
inconvenience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The study of the evolutionary moves or processes passed by eunuchism in
its relation to music and the drama tends to rob these otherwise
civilizing and enlightened arts of the aureoles of poetry and gentility
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
with which they have been surrounded. From Bergmann we learn that the
practice originated in the Orient, where female voices were held in
higher esteem in singing, and where the profane songs that accompanied
the dance were chanted by women. The Hebraic regulations permitted
neither women nor eunuchs to sing in their temples. With the
establishment of the early Christian Church in Oriental countries, more
or less of the ancient Judaic customs were retained, and in addition a
too literal interpretation of the words of St. Paul was adhered to,
which said that women should not be <i>heard</i> in the Church. The Oriental
Church from these reasons long remained in a quandary; according to the
ceremonials, it was deemed requisite to imitate as near as possible the
voices of the angelic seraphims, and this could not be done by the
rasping bass voices of the well-fed monks; women were out of the
question in the then social stage of church evolution; so that at last a
compromise was effected by admitting the eunuch, who could chant in a
most seraphic soprano, as his prototype, the mendicant priests of
Cybele, had done before him.</p>

<p>Constantinople became the centre of learning for Greek music, and the
fine soprano solos which now form the attraction of many of our modern
churches were sung by the eunuchs. Eunuchs were not only the chief
singers, but they cultivated the art into a science, and Constantinople
furnished through this class the music-teachers for the world, as we
learn that in 1137 the eunuch Manuel and two other singers of his order
established a school of music and singing in Smolensk, Russia. There is
no doubt but that in a moral sense, considering that women are generally
the pupils, this was a most meet and an appropriate arrangement; for,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
as St. Alphonsus M. Liquori observed, man was a fool to allow his
daughters or female wards to be taught letters by a man, even if that
man were a saint, and, as real saints were not to be found outside of
heaven, it can well be imagined how much more dangerous it might be to
have them taught music and singing by a man not a eunuch,&mdash;elements
which have a recognized special aphrodisiac virtue, as was well known to
the ancient Greeks, who only allowed their wives to listen to a certain
form of music when they (the husbands) were absent from home.</p>

<p>There is not much room for doubt but that both morality and medicine
have too much neglected the study and contemplation of the natural
history of man, and relied altogether too much on the efficacy of church
regulations and castor-oil and rhubarb. There are other things to be
done besides simply framing moral codes and pouring down mandrake into
the stomach; the old conjoined service of priest and doctor should never
have been discontinued, as, by dividing duties that are inseparable,
much harm has resulted. Herein dwelt the great benefit of the early
practice of medicine among the Greeks, and to the physical understanding
and supervision of human nature by the Hebraic law may be said that the
creed owes its greatness and stability, and the Hebrew race its sturdy
stamina. The wisdom of the Mosaic laws is something that always
challenges admiration, the secret being that it did not separate the
moral from the physical nature of man. Bain, Maudsley, Spencer, Haeckle,
Buckle, Draper, and all our leading sociologists base all their
arguments on the intimate relations that exist between the physical
surrounding and the physical condition of man and his morality. Churches
foolishly ignore all this.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
From Constantinople the fashion or custom gradually invaded Italy; and
as Rome was the centre of the new religion, so it also became the centre
of music, and Rome and Naples were soon the home of the eunuch devoted
or immolated to the science of music. The eunuchs reached the height of
their renown in music, as well as what might be termed their golden era,
with the establishment of the Italian opera, in the seventeenth century.
At this period all the stages of Italy were the scenes of the lyric
triumphs of this otherwise unfortunate class, some of whom accumulated
vast fortunes. In the following century, as has been seen, Clement XVI
abolished the practice as far as the church was concerned, and in the
present century the first Napoleon abolished the practice secularly and
socially. Mankind cannot sufficiently appreciate the benefits it
received from the results of the French Revolution; we are too apt to
look at that event simply from the unavoidable means which an uneducated
class&mdash;rendered desperate by long suffering and brutalization under an
organized system of oppressive misrule&mdash;had adopted to remedy existing
evils. After the dissolution of the Directory France cannot be said to
have been in a state of anarchy, and the long and bloody wars with which
Napoleon is usually blamed should rather be charged to that government
and imbecile ministerial policy that lost to England the American
colonies. The series of battles from Marengo to Waterloo are as much the
creation of the cabinet of George III as those from Concord to Yorktown.
Waterloo involved more than the simple defeat of Napoleon; it meant the
defeat of moral and intellectual progress, as well as the suppression of
the rights of man. The suppression of the Inquisition in Spain, and of
eunuchism in Italy; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the Code Napoleon; the Imperial highways of France; the construction of
its harbors,&mdash;notably that of Havre; and the political and social
emancipation of the Jews in France, Italy, and Germany are monuments to
this great man that have not their equals to crown the acts of any other
French monarch. Like the Phrygian monk who leaped into the arena in Rome
to separate the maddened gladiators, and who was stoned to death by the
angry and brutal mob of spectators whose amusement he stopped,
Napoleon&rsquo;s work has had its results, in spite of Waterloo and St.
Helena. The martyrdom of the poor monk caused an abolishment of the
brutal sports of the Colosseum, which henceforth crumbled to pieces.
Little did the people look for this result who trampled the monk under
foot. Neither did Blucher, debouching on the English left with
Bulow&rsquo;s battalions on the evening of Waterloo, foresee, some fifty
years later, Prussia extending its hand to make a united Italy, which
with Napoleon&mdash;who was by blood, nature, instinct, and education an
Italian&mdash;had been the dream and ambition of his life.</p>

<p>Eunuchism as a punishment is an old practice, as the ancient Egyptians
inflicted it at times upon their prisoners of war; so it formed part of
their penal code, and we are told that rape was punished by the loss of
the virile organ; a like punishment for the same offense was in vogue
with the Spaniards and Britons; with the Romans at different times and
with the Poles the punishment was castration. The difficulty of proving
the crime, as well as the ease with which the crime could be charged
through motives of revenge, spite, or cupidity on innocent persons,
should never have allowed this form of punishment to be so generally
used as history relates that it was; rape being one of the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
complex and intricate of medico-legal subjects, unless we take M.
Voltaire&rsquo;s summary and Solomonic judgment, who relates that a
queen, who did not wish to listen to a charge of rape made by one person
against another, took the scabbard of a sword and, while she kept the
open end in motion, asked the accuser to sheath the sword.</p>

<p>Count Raoul Du Bisson, <i>Dedjaz de l&rsquo;Abyssinie</i>, gives some very
interesting information in regard to eunuchism in his work entitled
&ldquo;The Women, the Eunuchs, and the Warriors of the Soudan.&rdquo;
Count Bisson has looked on the question from its moral, physical, and
demographic stand-points, and, having seen eunuchism in its different
aspects, from his landing at Alexandria and Cairo, down through his
different expeditions into Arabia, the Soudan, and Abyssinia, his
observations are well worth repeating.</p>

<p>From a demographic and statistical view of the subject, its truly
Malthusian results become at once shockingly and persistently
prominent,&mdash;not alone in the interference that the condition induces in
arresting any further procreation on the part of the unfortunate victim,
but in the unparalleled mortality that, in the gross, is made necessary
by the results of the operative procedures. The Soudan alone furnished,
according to reliable statistics, some 3800 eunuchs annually, the
material coming from Abyssinia and the neighboring countries, it being
gathered by war and kidnapping parties, or by purchase, from among the
young male population of those regions. These children are brought to
the Soudan frontier and custom duties are there paid for their passage
across the border, the duty being about two dollars per head. At
Karthoum they are purchased by pharmacists, apothecaries, and others
engaged in the manufacture of eunuchs, who generally perform simple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
castration; the mortality among these amounts to about 33 per cent.
These simply castrated eunuchs bring about $200 apiece. The great eunuch
factory of the country, however, is to be found on Mount Ghebel-Eter, at
Abou-Gergh&egrave;; here a large Coptic monastery exists, where the
unfortunate little African children are gathered. The building is a
large, square structure, resembling an ancient fortress; on the
ground-floor the operating-room is situated, with all the appliances
required to perform these horrible operations. The Coptic monks do a
thriving business, and furnish Constantinople, Arabia, and Asia Minor
with many of their complete, much-sought-for, and expensive eunuchs.
They here manufacture both grades,&mdash;those who are simply castrated
and those on whom complete ablation of all organs has been performed,
the latter bringing from $750 to $1000 per head, as only the most robust
are taken for this operation, which nevertheless, even at the monastery,
has a mortality of 90 per cent.</p>

<p>The manner of performing the operation is as barbarous and revolting as
the nature of the operation itself, and the cruel and ignorant
after-treatment is as fully in keeping with the whole. The little,
helpless, and unfortunate prisoner or slave is stretched out on an
operating-table; his neck is made fast in a collar fastened to the
table, and his legs spread apart and the ankles made fast to iron rings;
his arms are each held by an assistant. The operator then <ins
class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;siezes&rsquo;.">seizes</ins> the little penis and scrotum and with one
sweep of a sharp razor removes all the appendages. The resulting wound
necessarily bares the pubic bones and leaves a large, gaping sore that
does not heal kindly. A short bamboo cannula or catheter is then
introduced into the urethra, from which it is allowed to project for
about two inches, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and no attention is paid to any arterial h&aelig;morrhage; the whole
wound is simply plastered up with some h&aelig;mostatic compound and the
little victim is then buried in the warm sand up to his neck, being
exposed to the hot, scorching rays of the sun; the sand and soil is
tightly packed about his little body so as to prevent any possibility of
any movement on the part of the child, perfect immobility being
considered by the monks as the main element required to promote a
successful result. <i>It is estimated that 35,000 little Africans are
annually sacrificed to produce the Soudanese average quota of its 3800
eunuchs.</i></p>

<p>When this immense sacrifice of life, the useless barbarity, and the
really unnecessary needs of such mutilated humanity existing are fully
considered, it would seem as if Christian nations might, with some
reason, interfere in this horrible traffic, by the side of which
ordinary slavery seems but a trifle. When we further consider that, in
some instances, the child is also made mute by the excision of part of
the tongue,&mdash;as mute or dumb eunuchs are less apt to enter into
intrigues, and are therefore higher prized,&mdash;the barbarity, cruelty, and
extremes of inhumanity that these poor children have to suffer cannot be
overestimated. Neither must we be astonished at the stolid indifference
that is exhibited by the eunuchs in after life to any or all sentiments
of humanity, or that they should hold the rest of humanity in continual
execration.</p>

<p>Often-occurring accidents in harems make <i>complete</i> eunuchs a
desideratum. Bisson mentions that on one occasion he saw the chief
eunuch of the Grand Cherif of Mecca&mdash;a large, finely-proportioned,
powerful black&mdash;on his way to Stamboul for trial and sentence; he was
heavily chained and well guarded. It appears that the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
eunuch had only been partly castrated, and that the operation had been
performed during infancy; his testicles had not fully descended, so that
in the operation the sac was simply obliterated, which gave him the
appearance of a eunuch. In this condition he seemed to have kept a
perfect control of himself and passions until made chief eunuch of the
Cherif, who possessed a well-assorted harem of choice Circassian,
Georgian, and European beauties. The <i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i> toilet of
the harem bath and the seductive influence of this terrestrial Koranic
seventh heaven was too much for the warm Soudanese blood of the chief;
his forays were not suspected until a blonde Circassian houri presented
her lord and master, the Cherif, with a suspiciously mulatto-looking son
and heir. A consultation of the Koran failed to explain this
discrepancy, and suspicion pointed to the chief eunuch, who was
accordingly watched; it was found that he had not only corrupted the
fair Circassian, but every inmate of the harem as well. The harem was
promptly sacked and drowned and the false eunuch shipped to the Sultan
for sentence, the Cherif having the right to sentence and drown the
harem, but having no such rights over such a high personage as the chief
eunuch.</p>

<p>There are physiological facts and pathological conditions brought forth
for our contemplation, while investigating the subject of eunuchism in
all its details, that cause us to feel that, after all, the old
Hippocratic principle of inductive philosophy, upon which our study and
practice of medicine is founded, with rational experience and
observation for its corner-stone, is, even if commonplace, the only
proper avenue of knowledge. To exemplify this proposition we have in
this particular subject the practical observations and experience of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
M. Mondat, of Montpellier; in his interesting work on &ldquo;De la <ins
class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;St&egrave;rilit&egrave;&rsquo;.">St&eacute;rilit&eacute;</ins> de
l&rsquo;Homme et de la Femme,&rdquo; published in 1840, he details some
instructive information on the subject of eunuchs, giving some
explanation as to why many simply castrated eunuchs are, like the
much-prized eunuchs of the Roman matrons, still able to acquit
themselves of the copulative function. He mentions that while in Turkey
he studied the subject in its details, and, having found some of these
copulating eunuchs, he secured some of the ejaculated fluid and
subjected it to a careful examination. The discharge was lacking the
characteristic seminal odor; it was in other respects, to the palpation
especially, very much like the seminal fluid. He found that these
eunuchs were much given to venereal enjoyment, but that either
legitimate intercourse or masturbation, to which many were addicted, was
apt to be followed by a marasmus ending in galloping consumption. Mondat
personally knew the opera-singer Velutti, who died in London; Velutti
was, when a child, castrated by his parents, having both testicles
removed, being intended by his father, who had himself performed the
operation, for the choir of the Papal Chapel at Rome. Velutti was as
much of a favorite in his day as our present tenors and handsome actors.
The admiration of the opposite sex was fatal to him; he formed a
<i>liaison</i> with a young English lady residing in London, and the
resulting excesses in which he indulged quickly brought him to his
grave. He was passionately fond of women and was able to acquit himself
perfectly; at least, as far as the copulative act&mdash;barring
fecundation&mdash;was concerned.</p>

<p>In a previous part of this chapter I have alluded to the very
appropriate arrangement which formerly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
existed when music-teachers were eunuchs, and that our higher circles
of society would do well to employ eunuchized coachmen, especially if
possessed of susceptible and elopable daughters; but, from the accounts
given by Mondat, it would seem that they are not as safe as might at
first be imagined. However, they could not be as dangerous as the chief
eunuch of the Grand Cherif of Mecca and increase the population to the
same extent; but I should judge that they might be a very demoralizing
moral element if introduced into modern society. If eunuchs must be
employed, it can easily be understood why the Turk and Chinese prefer
the real, clean-cut article. The New York &ldquo;Four Hundred&rdquo;
should make a note of this, as in their present thirst for European
aristocratic notions, coats of arms and titles, there is no telling how
soon they may cross over into Oriental customs and run a harem, in which
case it would be sad to have them make any mistakes in the quality and
ability of the eunuch.</p>

<p>Dr. Gardner W. Allen has furnished the American profession with a
faithful translation of the valuable work of Professor Ultzmann on
&ldquo;Sterility and Impotence.&rdquo; In this, we have a clear and
intelligent dissertation that explains the above conditions, and I am
only surprised that the observations of Mondat have not developed such
explanations before, as the principle was fully explained in practice
fifty years ago by the Montpellier physician. According to Ultzmann,
there is a form of fecundating impotence in persons otherwise well
provided with an apparent complete apparatus, an impotence which he
terms <i>potentia generandi</i>. He states, however, that this form of
impotence was not recognized until a few years ago, citing the fact that
females have had, as a rule, to bear all of the blame for the
unfruitfulness <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of the family, and that they have been accordingly subjected to all
manner of operations, general and local treatment, even to being sent to
watering places and sanatoria where red-headed male attendants are
employed, to say nothing of the prayers, intercessions, pilgrimages, and
novenas to the holy shrines, as mentioned in the chapter on the holy
prepuce. Ultzmann observes that a man may be perfectly able to go
through the procreative or, rather, the copulative act, even to the
great satisfaction of all parties concerned, and yet be perfectly
impotent; he even goes further, by observing that there are cases in
which copulation may take place without any fluid whatever being
ejaculated. He mentions two such cases at pages 87 and 116 of his book.
In the first instance the ejaculated fluid is precisely as that observed
in such cases as those of the eunuchs and of Velutti, mentioned by
Mondat, and consisted of an azo&ouml;spermic discharge, made up mainly
from the secretion of the seminal vesicles, the accessory glands of the
urethra, the prostate, and Cowper&rsquo;s glands, as well as the
discharge from the secretory glands distributed along the course of the
urethral mucous membrane. Some of the cases of this form of impotence
have exhibited wonderful copulating desire and power of endurance, and,
even if unfecundating, they must be said to be better off than the
victims of that other form of male impotence, the <i>potentia coeundi</i> of
Ultzmann, where, with a normal semen, either the power of erection or
that of ejaculation may be entirely absent.</p>

<span class='sc sf75'>Philosophical Considerations Relating to Eunuchism and Medicine.</span></h2>

<p>Eunuchism does not always subdue the animal passions; this is the view
that the church took in connection with the emasculation of Origenes and
his monks; the church here held that not only was it possible for them
to still sin in heart or imagination, but that, even were the complete
eradication of the sexual idea possible, they had by their act lost the
main glory of a Christian,&mdash;that of successfully striving against
temptation, and by a force born of triumphant virtue overcome all the
wiles of the devil. It is related that among the eunuchs at Rome there
were some who, having been made so late in life, still retained the
power of copulation, although the final act of the performance was
absent. Montfalcon relates that Cabral reported dissecting a soldier who
was hanged for committing a rape, but who on dissection showed not the
least trace of testicles, either in the scrotum or abdomen, although the
seminal vesicles were filled with some fluid.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Sprengle, in his &ldquo;History of Medicine,&rdquo; relates of the
complete removal of both testicles from an old man of seventy years of
age, on account of inordinate sexual desire, the operation having no
perceptible effect in subduing the disease.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
These cases are analogous to those exceptionable cases in which, after
extirpation of the ovaries, both menstruation and fecundation have still
taken place.</p>

<p>Modern civilization and its unnatural mode of dressing inflict great
harm on men by keeping these parts <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
too warm and constricted. Much of the irritability of these organs, as
well as their <i>decadence</i> at an age some generation or two before the
time when they should still possess all their virile attributes, can be
directly attributed to this cause. A more intelligent way of dressing
would result in less moral and physical wreckage, and require less
galvanic belts and aphrodisiacs in men under fifty. If those who
habitually swath their scrotums in the heavy folds of their flannel
shirts, to which are superadded the cotton shirts, drawers, and outer
clothes in which civilized man incases himself, would cast a backward
eye into the dim and misty past, and see the priest of some of the old
Pagan gods soaking the scrotum in hot water, and then gradually rubbing
the testicles within, by gentle but firm friction, <i>to make the
testicles disappear</i>, a process by which many of the heathen priests
prepared themselves for the discharge of their sacerdotal duties and the
strict observance of those rules of chastity and celibacy which they
were henceforth to live up to, they would find <i>one</i> explanation of why
civilized man does not possess that vigor and retain that procreative
power into advanced age that was one of the characteristics of our
ancient progenitors in the days that breeches were as abbreviated as
those now worn by the Sioux Indians. These are really but leggins, which
run only to the perineum and are simply tied by outer points to a strap
from each hip. Finely and comfortably cushioned chairs may be a luxury
to sit on, but they will have, on the man who uses them in youth and in
his prime, a wonderful sedative and moral influence later on, about as
effectual as the miniature warm baths for the scrotum and gentle
pressure to the testicles that were used by the heathen priests of old,
who preferred a gradual disappearance of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the glands to the too sudden and summary methods of the Cybelian
clergy, who used a piece of shell and an elaborately-performed
castration. According to Paulus &AElig;gineta, this was a common
practice of making eunuchs out of young boys in the Orient, the
mortality being hardly any; whereas the <i>taill&egrave; &agrave; fleur de
ventre</i>, the favorite method for making eunuchs for harem guards and
attendants, and more suited to the jealous disposition of the Turk, has
a mortality of three out of every four, according to Chardin, and of two
out of every three, according to Clot Bey, the chief physician of the
Pasha,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
and of nine out of ten, according to Bisson. So prone to reach high
offices were intelligent eunuchs that it is related that parents were at
times induced to treat their boys in the manner above stated, that they
might be on the highway to royal favor, honor, and rank; such is the
ennobling tendency of Oriental despotism, polygamy, and harem life. On
the same principle Europeans subjected their boys to a like operation to
fit them for a chorister life or the stage, where fame and honor and
wealth were to be found.</p>

<p>Medicine has been the butt of wits and philosophers, as well as of the
men who, from the profession, have gone into the ranks of literature.
Smollet, himself a physician, gives us an insight into our wandering and
erratic misapplication of our knowledge on therapeutics in
&ldquo;Peregrine Pickle,&rdquo; where the poor painter, Pallet, is
believed to be a victim of hydrophobia. The learned opinion of the
doctor, who explains the many and various reasons by which he arrives at
his diagnosis, the various physical signs exhibited by the patient as
being pathognomonic of the disease, and his final venture with the
contents of the <i>pot de chambre</i>, as a diagnosis verifier, which he
dashes in the patient&rsquo;s face in preference <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to ordinary water on account of the medicinal virtues contained in
urine, which in the case seemed to him to have a peculiar therapeutic
value, is something worth reading, however ludicrous it all sounds.
There are few intelligent physicians but who have seen as ridiculous
performances, in what might be called medical gymnasts, that equal, if
not surpass, those of Smollet&rsquo;s doctor. Rabelais was also a
professional brother, who, equally with Smollet, attempted to waken up
the profession by his satires. Smollet was not only a physician, but in
his early life had seen some very active and practical work, having
participated in and been a witness to the ills and misfortunes that
follow any attempts to &ldquo;lock horns&rdquo; with nature through
ignorance of physical laws and preventive medicine,&mdash;having been a
surgeon&rsquo;s mate in the fleet which assisted the land forces in the
murderous and ill-fated Carthagena expedition which cost England so many
lives, ignorantly and needlessly sacrificed to ministerial disregard of
physical laws and its consequences,&mdash;lessons which, unfortunately,
seem to have but little effect on cabinets, owing to their shifting
<i>personelle</i>, England following up the disasters of Carthagena with the
still greater blunder of the Walcheren expedition, where, out of
England&rsquo;s small available physical war material, nearly forty
thousand men were either left to fatten the swamps of Walcheren, or to
wander through England in after years on the pension-list, physical
wrecks and in bodily and financial misery.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Again, the same disregard, born of ignorance and red tape, crippled the
British army in the Crimea, causing in its ranks the greatest mortality.
It has seemed as if it would be of advantage if all the blunders, either
philosophical or of statesmanship, committed by a cabinet, should be
written in large letters of gold, to be hung <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in the council-halls of the nations, that similar blunders at least
might not occur again.</p>

<p>Dumas, in his &ldquo;History of the Two Centuries&rdquo; and his
&ldquo;History of the Century of Louis the XIV,&rdquo; gives some very
interesting medical touches. Le Sage, in his &ldquo;Adventures of Gil
Blas,&rdquo; gives us food for speculating on medical philosophy in
connection with the interesting subject of how to make the profession
remunerative. Dickens&rsquo;s ideas of the doctor, as given in his
works, are life touches. Witness his description of the little doctor
who superintended little David Copperfield&rsquo;s advent into the
world, or of Dr. Slammer of the army; they represent his view of the
professional character. Fontenelle, probably, was right in ascribing the
fact of his becoming a centenarian, and maintaining a stomach with the
force and resistance that are the peculiar characteristics and
attributes of a chemical retort, to the fact that when sick it was his
practice to throw the doctor&rsquo;s physic out of the window as the
doctor went out of the door, as in his day a man required the
constitution of a rhinoceros and the stomach of an ostrich, with the
external insensibility of a crocodile, to withstand the ordinary doctor
of the period and his medications. Napoleon believed that Baron Larrey
was the most virtuous, intelligent, useful, and unselfish man in
existence; in fact, it is doubtful if any man of his time commanded from
this truly great man so much admiration or respect, either for bravery,
courage, intelligence, or activity, as the great and simple-minded
Larrey. As observed by Napoleon of his bravest general,&mdash;poor Marshal
Ney, the bravest of the brave, the rear guard of the grand army, the
last man to leave Russian soil,&mdash;Ney was a lion in action, but a fool in
the closet. All his generals had some great distinguishing
characteristic, beyond which was a barren waste, a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
vacuity, but too apparent to a man of Napoleon&rsquo;s discernment. But
the cool, unflinching bravery of Larrey, that did not require the
stimulus of the fight or the phrenzy of strife to bring it to the
surface and keep it alive; bravery and intelligence alike active under
showers of shot and shell or in the thunders of charging squadrons; in
the face of infective epidemics or contagiousness, walking about in
these scenes in which his own life was as much at stake as that of the
meanest soldier, with the same cool exercise of his intelligence that he
exhibited in the organization and superintendence of his hospitals in
the time of peace; always the same, untiring, unmurmuring, brave,
studious, observing, unflinching in his duties, unselfish; whether in
the burning sands of Egypt or in the snowy steppes of Russia, in the
marshy plains of Italy or in the highlands of Spain, he always found him
the same, and his notes and observations, from his first government
service on the Newfoundland coast to his last, always showed him the
same laborer and student in the field of medicine. And yet at St. Helena
we find Napoleon refusing to take remedies for internal disease whose
real nature was unknown, and only toward the end did he consent to take
anything, and then only when seeing that the end was approaching, and
more from a kindly desire to express his appreciation of the services of
his attendants, and not to wound their feelings, than from any hope of
assistance. Napoleon had not neglected the study of medicine any more
than he had the study of every other science. This is evident from the
instance related as taking place during the march of the grand army from
the confines of Poland into Russia, in 1812, when dysentery became very
prevalent, of his inviting several of his favorite guard to his own
table, where he experimented <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
on each particular grenadier with a specific form of diet, so as to
determine its cause and possible remedy. He did not look upon our
knowledge of pathology and our skill in diagnosis as being sufficiently
advanced or perfect to make him feel but that a treatment for an obscure
disease like his own would be pretty much a matter of guess-work.
Charles Reade, in his &ldquo;Man and Wife,&rdquo; shows an intimate
knowledge of medical science where he philosophizes on the effects of an
irregular life and of over-physical training. His logic is sound
science. Defoe and Cervantes show a like intelligent insight as to
medicine; and it was not without reason that Sydenham, the English
Hippocrates, advised a student of medicine who entered his office as a
student to begin the study of medicine by the careful study of
&ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; remarking that he found it a work of great
value, which he still often read. The works of Bacon and of Adam Smith
on &ldquo;Moral Sentiments;&rdquo; the famous treatise on the
&ldquo;Natural History of Man,&rdquo; by the Rev. John Adams; the later
works of Buckle, Spencer, Darwin, Draper, Lecky, and other robust
wielders of the Anglo-Saxon pen, as well as the works of Montaigne,
Montesquieu, La Fontaine, and Voltaire, are all works that the medical
man could probably read with more profit than loss of time. In fact,
either Hume, Macaulay, or any philosophical work on history will furnish
to the physician additional knowledge of use in his profession. No
physician can afford to neglect any study that in any manner adds to his
knowledge of the natural history of man, as therein is to be found the
foundation of our knowledge as to what constitutes health, and as to
what are the causes that lead humanity to diverge from the paths of
health into those of physical degeneracy and mental and bodily disease.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
We have in medicine many sayings which pass for truisms, which are,
after all, misleading. We say, for instance, keep the feet warm and the
head cool; this will not always either keep you comfortable or well, as
we know that in neuralgias it is absolutely necessary, either for
comfort or to get well, to keep the head warm. While so much stress is
laid on the necessity of keeping the head cool, a thing a person is sure
to look after whenever the head becomes uncomfortably warm, and to which
can be ascribed but few ailments or deaths, we hear comparatively
nothing about the thermometric condition of the perineum, which, from
the varying temperatures in which it is at times plunged, produces more
beginnings for diseases in the future, during youth and our prime, as
well as it quite often causes the sudden ending of life in more advanced
periods. People who carefully observe the rule of keeping their heads
cool and their feet warm will stand with outspread legs and uplifted
coat-tails with their backs to a blazing grate, and then, going outside,
incontinently sit down on a stone or iron door-step, or, stepping into a
carriage or other vehicle, they sit down on a cold oil-cloth or leather
cushion, without the least knowledge of the harm or danger that they are
liable to incur. They little dream of the prostatic troubles that lie in
wait for the unwary sitter on cold places, ready to pounce upon him like
the treacherous Indian lying in ambush,&mdash;troubles that carry in their
train all the battalions of urethral, bladder, kidney disease and
derangments, and subsequent blood disorganization, which often begin in
a chilled perineum, and, in conjunction with the local disease that may
result, end in handing us over to Father Charon for ferriage across the
gloomy Styx long before our life&rsquo;s journey is half over. It is
true, neither the savage <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of Africa or America nor the nomads of Asia are subject to any of these
troubles; but with us, hampered with all the benefits of the dress,
diet, habits, and luxuries of civilization, and with a civilized
prostatic gland, it is quite otherwise. Herein, again, comes that
connection between religion, morality, and medicine, that existed with
so much benefit to mankind, but from which we of later days have, in our
greater wisdom, seen fit to separate; although, inconsistently as it may
seem, the present age has done more than any previous epoch in
practically demonstrating the intimate and inseparable relation existing
between the physical and moral nature of man. The persistent priapism
which oftentimes results from riding with a wet seat and the inordinate
morbid sensibility of the sexual organs that may result from the same
cause or from spinal irritation are not to be allayed by any homily on
morality or on the sanctifying attempts at keeping the animal passions
under subjection, any more than will prayers or offerings to all the
gods of Olympus restore the eunuchized, either through foolish civilized
dress and customs or through excessive indulgence. We must mix medicine
with our religion and make the clergy into physicians, or ordain our
physicians into full-fledged clergymen.</p>

<p>The science of medicine, or what might be called the natural ways of
nature through its physical laws, is true to itself; the fault lies in
our interpretation of its phenomena, which we fail to study with
sufficient discriminative precision and nicety. We have repeatedly
mistaken causes and results from this want of close observance and of
precision, attributing results to causes which did not exist. As an
example, when the early disciples of hom&oelig;opathy in ancient Palestine
undertook to revive poor, old, withered King David, by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
putting him to bed with a young and caloric-generating Sunamite maid,
when it was by like incontinent practices that he had brought himself to
that state of decrepitude, it is plain that they misunderstood the
principle. Boerhaave&mdash;who, as a true eclectic practitioner,
followed these ancient and Biblical hom&oelig;opaths in their practice
in a similar case, the subject being an old Dutch burgomaster, whom he
sandwiched between a couple of rosy Netherland maids&mdash;also failed
to grasp the true condition of the nature of things, or the true
philosophical explanation. The exhalations from the aged are by no means
an elixir of health or life to the young, and the fact that the young
were apt to lose health by sleeping with the aged was wrongly attributed
to their loss being the <ins class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s
Note: The original showed &lsquo;others&rsquo;.">others&rsquo;</ins> gain, and
the result of its passing into the bodies of their aged companions, and
not to its true cause,&mdash;the deteriorating influence to which they
were subjected; and, further, when we analyze the subject still more, we
can understand how a full-blooded and active, lithe-bodied, thin, and
active-skinned Sunamite maid might and would impart caloric to King
David; but, from our knowledge (not altogether practical) of the
difference that exists between differently constitutioned and
differently built maids in imparting caloric, and from our knowledge of
the physique of the Netherland maids, who are cold and impassive, with a
layer of adipose tissue that answers the same purpose as that of the
blubber in the whale,&mdash;that of retaining heat and resisting
cold,&mdash;we can well believe that the poor, shriveled burgomaster
could receive but little heat, even when sandwiched between the two;
but, on the contrary, he was, in fact, more liable to lose the little he
had, unless we look at the subject in another light, and consider that
sentiment that is common to both animals and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
men of spirit, a sentiment that has furnished the subject for more than
one canvas in the hands of the true and sympathetic artist, as seen on
the awakening and alert attitude of the worn-out and old decrepit
war-horse, browsing in an inclosed pasture, as he hears from afar the
familiar bugle-notes of his early youth, or some cavalry regiment with
prancing steeds and jingling accoutrements, with bright colors and
shining arms, going past the pasture, restoring for a time to the
stiffening joints and dim eyes the suppleness and fire of bygone times,
with visions of gallant charges and prancing reviews; or, how the same
sentiment erects once more the bowed and withering frame of the old
veteran, and once again fires his soul with the martial zeal of his
prime as he sees the passing colors and active-stepping regiment which
he followed in the bright sunshine and flush of his youth. Aside from
these sentiments, which might possibly have inspired David and the Dutch
burgomaster with an infusion of a new and transient good feeling, it is
unquestionable but that some heated brickbats or stove-lids, curocoa
jugs or old stone Burton ale-bottles filled with hot-water, would have
been more effectual in imparting warmth than either Sunamite or
Netherland maids.</p>

<p>It is hard to reconcile the beliefs of some people or nations with their
manners and customs. For instance, there is the Turk; when a Jew becomes
a Mohammedan he is made to acknowledge that Jesus Christ, the son of
Mary, is the expected Messiah, and that none other is to be expected;
they know of Christ&rsquo;s speech on the cross, made to the repentant
thief; they believe in a heaven full of houris, with large black eyes
and faces like the moon at its full, in which all good Moslems are to
have continual rejoicings, and yet they go on performing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the most barbarous and inhuman forms of castration imaginable, which
not only deprives its victims of their virility, but subject more than
three-fourths of those operated upon to a painful death, and the
remaining to a life of continual misery. Have these poor subjects no
right to future bliss, or in what shape will they reach there? If the
heavens of these eunuchisers were like the heaven of Buddhism, or, as
the Chinese call it, the Paradise of the West, where, although all forms
of sensual gratifications are to be enjoyed, no houris are to be
supplied to the saints of Buddhism,&mdash;as even the women who enter
this paradise must first change their sex,&mdash;we might understand
that, the genitals not being needed in the eternal world, it might be
considered a matter of small moment to compel a man to go through this
short and transient life without them; but where a robust condition of
the sexual organs is suggested as one of the heavenly requisites, it
would seem as if the Turk would look upon the suffering, misery, and
death that they cause, in connection with the inhuman mutilation they
inflict, with horror. Doctrinal theology, whether in the East or West,
is something incomprehensible.</p>

<hr /><p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>Hermaphrodism and Hypospadias.</span></h2>

<p>There exists a class of human beings whose description is connected with
the subject of this work. They date back to mythological times, and the
confusion incident to the misapplication of names and the want of proper
observation on the part of the narrators has tended to carry the
uncertainty of their real existence to the present day. One reason that
this part of the subject would be incomplete without their description
is on account of the origin of their existence being intimately
connected with eunuchism, being, in fact, an outgrowth of this
condition; and any history of eunuchism would be but half told, without
the additional information concerning these persons.</p>

<p>Hermaphrodites, as stated, date back to mythology. Tradition tells us
that Hermaphroditus, a son of Venus and Mercury, was educated by the
Naiades dwelling on Mount Ida. At the age of fifteen years, he began his
travels; while resting in the cool shades on the woody banks of a
fountain and spring near Caira, he was approached by the presiding nymph
of the fountain, Talmacis, who, becoming enamored of him, attempted to
seduce him. Hermaphroditus, like Joseph, was the pattern and mirror of
continence, and would not be seduced. Talmacis then, like
Potiphar&rsquo;s wife, seized on the unlucky pattern of virtue, and
prayed to the gods that they should so amalgamate poor Hermaphroditus to
her body as to make them one. The prayer was heard on Olympus, and
forthwith the two became one, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
but with the distinctive characteristics of each sex unchanged. Thus
began that fabled race of the <i>androgynes</i> of the ancients. Another
tradition, which is probably correct, affirms that ancient Carnia, or
Halicarnassus, was in those days the Baden-Baden of Asia Minor; that
thither repaired all the victims of gluttony, debauchery, and general
physical bankruptcy. Its name in ancient Caria denotes its
seaside-resort location, Hali-Karnas-Sos meaning literally
&ldquo;Karnassus-by-the-sea,&rdquo; like Boulogne-sur-mer. The city was
under the protection of Hermes and Aphrodite, whose temples were near
each other. Human nature in the days of Halicarnassus did not much
differ from human nature at Monte Carlo or Baden-Baden. The baths had a
number of young and handsome eunuchs who waited on the old, debauched,
and nervous wrecks, and the nymph who presided over the whole was
Talmakis, a name derived from the salty nature of the springs which fed
the baths; this nymph was worshiped as Aphrodite. Pederasty was one of
the practices at these baths. From these conjoined conditions the place
was said to be peopled with hermaphrodites,&mdash;meaning, at first,
simply that they were under the protection of Hermes and Aphrodite; and
latterly the name was attached to the passive agent in the pederastic
art,&mdash;a name that has followed the class and crossed the ocean into
the interior wilds of America, as in Powell&rsquo;s history of the
manners and customs of the Omahas, an Indian tribe of the Missouri, we
find that they at times practiced pederasty, the passive agent being
called by the Indians an hermaphrodite, or double sexed.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The relations that from eunuchism led to pederasty are very easy of
explanation. Eunuchism induces an effeminate form, softer body, and
prevents the growth <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of the beard; the voice is softer and more melodious; and their
timidity renders them also more effeminate, obedient, and dependent. The
peculiar commingling of the female form with that of the male furnished
to the sculptors the models for those wonderfully well-made forms which
are yet to be seen, representing in statuary the forms of Androgynes and
Hermaphrodites; that of the favorite eunuch of the emperor Adrian being
remarkable for the symmetry of its form and grace of pose.</p>

<p>Europe must have been astonished at the tales that were carried back by
the early explorers and voyagers, in relation to the New World. The
story of the immensity of the quantity of gold and silver, of great
stores of hidden treasures, of the quantities of precious gems and
priceless crystals was fully discounted when, from the Florida coast and
the explorers of the Lower Mississippi, men returned with the tale that
in the everglades and in the trackless forests, intersected by navigable
sloughs, there dwelt a people half of whom were hermaphrodites. Neither
the explorers nor their European historiographers seem able to have
grasped the true state of affairs. Many believed in the actual existence
of such numbers of these monstrosities, while others, arguing from what
was then known regarding the extraordinary development of the nymph&aelig; and
clitoris, as well as of the great labia, of the women in the African
regions, concluded that these supposed <i>androgynes</i>, or hermaphrodites,
must be women, the dress assumed by these and the menial labors to which
they were consigned assisting to favor this opinion. The early
Franciscan missionaries to California found the men who were used for
pederasty dressed as women.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Hammond mentions the practice as in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
vogue among the Indians of the southwest, which in a measure greatly
resembled that of the ancient Scythians in its operation, the men being
dressed as women, associating with women, and used for pederastic
purposes during the orgies of their festivals. These men had previously
been eunuchised by a process of continued and persistent onanism, which
caused at the end a complete atrophization of the testicle.</p>

<p>In regard to the great number of hermaphrodites observed in Florida and
on the Mississippi, the accounts are only reliable as far as they were
present in female garb and in an apparent state of slavery, being
compelled to do all the menial labor of the villages and camps, besides
being used for pederasty, no examination having been made by any
traveler. Their lot was different from those described by Hammond in his
work on &ldquo;Male Impotence,&rdquo; where the whole transaction seems
to have some sort of religious and civil significance. In Florida,
however, they tilled the ground, extricated and carried off the dead
during a battle, and did all the work generally, being used for beasts
of burden and not allowed to cut their hair; but all authorities are
silent or in complete ignorance as to whether they had suffered
castration. Pere Lafiteau, however, gives an explanation which was in
the last century considered ridiculous, but which, in the light that has
been thrown on the existence of a former continent, and of the
undisputable relation that must, some ages in the past, have existed
between Ph&oelig;nicia and Central America, seems a strongly probable
solution of these customs. The Father accounts for the presence of these
American <i>androgynes</i> in the following manner: The Carribeans, or
Caribs, were originally a colony from Carnia; with these colonists was
brought over the worship of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Pagan gods of Caria and Phrygia; these two localities were the homes of
the Cybelian priesthood, who dressed in female garb, as did the
sacrificial priests of the Temple of Venus Urania. It is true that the
Java or Floridian priest had nothing in common with the priests of
Cybele or of Venus Urania; but, still, Lafiteau gave as lucid an
explanation for the existence of these conditions as any of his
contemporaries. Charlevoix observed the same practices among the
Illinois, which he attributed as being due to some principle of
religion. The Baron de la Hontan insists that the missionary,
Charlevoix, was mistaken; that the persons whom he saw in female attire,
whom he took to be men, were not men. Hontan asserts that they were
veritable hermaphrodites. The missionaries were, however, correct, as
what has since been observed confirms their opinion. M. du Mont, who
ascended the Mississippi for a distance of nine hundred leagues, also
reported meeting Indians at different places attended by these
petticoated androgynes.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>As strange as it may seem, many intelligent men were loth to part with
their belief in the existence of these double-sexed individuals; the
logic used by many of these insisters of hermaphrodism, although now
very ridiculous, was no doubt sensible logic one hundred and fifty years
ago. As a matter of curiosity, some of this reasoning will bear
repeating. It is taken from a Latin edition of an ancient description of
Florida, originally in the English, but translated into the Latin by the
geographer, Mercator. In this book we find the roots of some of the
myths that led Ponce de Leon and his steel-clad warriors to wander
through Florida in a vain search of that spring or fountain of the
waters of perpetual youth and of everlasting life which they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
never to find. We there learn that, in the days of the good old Spanish
knight, the inhabitants of Florida lived to a very old age, and that
they did not marry until very late in life, as before that period it was
very difficult to determine the sex of the individual.</p>

<p>From what has since been seen among the Indians, the probability is that
these were really eunuchs, and probably in slavery, as the result of the
fortunes of war, as their great number and servile condition will hardly
admit of the belief that they belonged to the same tribe as their
masters and oppressors. Pederasty was an old, very old practice, being
mentioned before circumcision; it prevailed among many of the Orientals,
and among the many peoples by whom the early Jews were surrounded, who
were, according to the Old Testament, about as an immoral, dissolute,
and bestial a set as one could well imagine. Their religions were
nothing but a gross mixture of stupid superstition and blind idolatry,
pederasty, fornication, and general cussedness. In the then state of the
Jewish nation, to have allowed them to mingle freely with these people
would have ended in having the Jews adopt all their customs and habits.
The aim of the Jewish leaders was to prevent any too free intercourse of
their people with these nations, that they might remain uncontaminated
even while dwelling near them. To accomplish this it was necessary to
raise a barrier that would be the distinguishing mark of the Jewish
nation. Jahns, in his learned work on the &ldquo;History of the Hebrew
Commonwealths,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
lays down the idea that circumcision, as well as many articles in their
laws,&mdash;which to us appear trivial,&mdash;were in reality intended
to separate the Jews farther and farther from their idolatrous, bestial,
and heathenish neighbors, while at the same time these same ordinances
were intended <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to preserve a constant knowledge of the true and only God, and maintain
their moral and physical health.</p>

<p>Although hermaphrodism on a large scale, as an existing condition, was a
matter of serious belief at the end of the eighteenth century, it has
occupied no little attention in this. Courts have been called to decide
on cases to invalidate marriages, or to decide the sex, more than once;
and physicians are often asked the question, Do hermaphrodites really
exist? Dr. Debierre, of Lyons, published in 1886 a valuable paper,
entitled &ldquo;Hermaphrodism Before the Civil Code: its Nature, Origin,
and Social Consequences,&rdquo; which was published in the <i>Archives of
Criminal Anthropology</i> of Lyons, France. In this short but very concise
treatise, Debierre gives us a complete review of the subject from
mythological times to 1886. It must be quite evident to all that there
exists no logical reasons why the sexual or generative organs should be
exempt from, at times, being subject to variations from the normal,
either through the commingling of two conceptions or of faulty
development affecting other parts of the body,&mdash;conditions that go to
form monstrosities. Debierre gives one peculiar case of a duplication of
vagina and uterus in a girl of nineteen, the appearance of the parts and
the septum between the vagin&aelig; giving to the whole an appearance
precisely similar to that of a double-barreled shot-gun. These
monstrosities are as likely to happen as the different forms that
affect&mdash;either by arrested development or some abnormality of excessive
development&mdash;the head, which is a very prolific subject of anomalies.</p>

<p>Hermaphrodism is a common attribute in the vegetable kingdom, where
fixed habitation or position makes such a condition necessary; it is
also common to many <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of our lower forms of animal life, and even in the human f&oelig;tus
the presence of the Wolfian bodies and the canal of M&uuml;ller in the
same individual attest a primitive case or condition of hermaphrodism.
In other words, humanity begins its existence in a state of
hermaphrodism. This condition is found up to the end of the second month
of f&oelig;tal life in the human being, in common with all mammals, as
well as all the vertebrates, where, however, it is subject to variations
as to time of development and limit of existence in the normal
condition. In the chick, it is only after the fourth day that the
genital gland begins to determine whether it will turn into an ovary or
a testicle; in the rabbit it is on the fifteenth day, and in the human
embryo on the thirtieth day. Hermaphrodism does not occur, however, from
this at first uncertain state of affairs, but rather from subsequent
developments of the external organs that by their abnormality of
formation simulate one or the other sex, while the internal organs may
belong without any equivocation of structure to its definite sex; as it
has often happened that some of these cases, having been the subject of
differences of opinion among experts during life, were, after death,
unanimously assigned to one sex by all of the same experts, the organs
readily defining the sex being completely of the one sex. As observed by
Debierre, where the subject is really a female, even where the vagina or
uterus is unperceived, the presence of the menstrual function or some
physical disturbance at its stated periods are sufficient evidences, as
a rule, by which to determine the sex. The case of Marzo Joseph, or
Josephine, reported by Crecchio in 1865, had rudiments of an hypospadic
penis ten centimetres in length and a prostate of the male sex, with a
vagina 6 centimetres in length and 4 in circumference, ovaries,
oviducts, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
uterus of the female; it was not until her death, at the age of
fifty-six, that her sex was fully determined. The case reported by
Sippel in 1880, supposed to be a male from external evidences, was at
death found to be a female. Guttmann reported a like case in 1882. The
celebrated case of Michel-Ann Dronart is remarkable; this case was
declared a male by Morand Pere and a female by Burghart, as well as by
Ferrein; declared asexual or neutral by the Danish surgeon, Kruger; of
doubtful sex by Mertrud. The case of Marie-Madeleine Lefort, to which
Debierre devotes four figures, is full of interest. One of the figures
is her portrait at the age of sixteen, and another is from her
photograph at the age of sixty-five. She has a man&rsquo;s head in every
particular of physiognomy and expression, having in the latter figure a
full beard and the peculiar intellectual development of a male sage; she
has the hairy breast of the man, with the mammary development of the
female, and an abnormally-enlarged clitoris, which was often mistaken
for the male organ. The vagina at its lower end was narrow, and the
urethral aperture opened into it some distance from its outer opening;
otherwise she was sexually a perfect woman, and menstruated regularly.
Debierre quotes the case which Duval gives in his work on
hermaphrodites, wherein a man asked for a dissolution of marriage,
claiming that his wife had a male organ, which, although she was a woman
in every other sense, prevented by its interference the consummation of
the marriage act. The court had the case examined, when it was found
that the erection of the clitoris, which was large, was enough to
interfere as the husband had stated. It decreed that the young woman
should have the objectionable and interfering member amputated, and on
the refusal to have this done the marriage should be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
dissolved. She refused, and the divorce was consequently granted to the
man.</p>

<p>From the history of Marie Lefort, it can well be conceived how the
popular mind, in ignorant times, could easily be imposed upon. Montaigne
relates the history of a Hungarian soldier who was confined of a
well-developed infant while in camp, and of a monk brought to a
successful accouchement in the cell of a convent; while Duval reports
the case of a priest in Paris who was found to be pregnant with child,
who was in consequence imprisoned in the prison of the ecclesiastical
court. These cases were strongly females in every sense, but with some
male characteristic sufficiently developed, like in the case of Marie
Lefort, to allow them to believe themselves men and to pass for such.</p>

<p>On the other hand, males have had some female characteristics so well
pronounced that they have passed for females. Debierre mentions a number
of cases, to wit: Ambroise Par&eacute; reported such a case in his time;
Ladowsky, of Reims, reports the case of Marie Goulich, who, up to the
age of thirty-three, was believed to be a female, at which time the
descent of the testicles removed all doubts as to sex. Sheghelner and
Cheselden have reported analogous cases, and Girand&rsquo;s case&mdash;who
was happily married to a man with whom he lived until the death of the
husband, in which the only female attribute was a blind vagina, which,
in his case, seems to have answered all purposes&mdash;was a most remarkable
case. As a rule, the cases of males who have been mistaken for
hermaphrodites have been cases of hypospadic urethr&aelig; in a greater or
lesser sense of deformity.</p>

<p>Debierre, however, mentions some cases of true hermaphrodism. He quotes
a number of cases, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
earliest being from the writings of C&oelig;lius Rhodigin, who claimed
to have seen in Lombardy a case in which the organs of the two sexes
were side by side; Ambroise Par&eacute; records that in 1426 a pair of
twins were born, joined back to back, wherein both were hermaphrodites.
Among the many reporters that he quotes, he mentions Rokitansky, who
reported a case in 1869, at Vienna, this being the autopsy of Hohmann,
who had two ovaries and oviducts, a rudimentary uterus, and a testicle,
with a sperm-duct containing spermatozoa. This individual menstruated
regularly, and it is an interesting question as to what the result would
have been had some of the spermatic fluid come in contact with some of
the ovules that were periodically discharged. Hohmann had an imperforate
penis and a bifide scrotum. Ceccherelli, who gives a more minute
description of this interesting case, relates that Hohmann, who died at
the age of forty, had menstruated regularly to the age of thirty-eight.
The penis was imperforate but hypospadic, from whence came the urinary
and spermatic discharges, and Hohmann could in turn copulate as either
male or female. Odin is also quoted in relation to the case seen at the
H&ocirc;tel-Dieu-de-Lyon, during the service of M. Bondet. The subject
was aged sixty-three, and named Mathieu Perret. The case greatly
resembled that of Hohmann, at the autopsy being found to be double
sexed. So that, while most of the cases mentioned are fictitious and
only apparent, the fact remains that the existence of true
hermaphrodites is indisputable.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>If the subject of either apparently or true hermaphrodism is one of
unhappiness, and oftentimes of discomfort and misery, history relates
that this unfortunate class has suffered additionally, from the laws and
action of ignorant and barbarian times, as such freaks of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
nature must of necessity have occurred at all times; only in the then
ignorant state of medicine and anatomy they must have been considered as
occurring much oftener&mdash;every deviation from the normal being
considered as hermaphroditic. Opmeyer relates that in excavating in the
neighborhood of the capitol in Rome, the laborers discovered the bronze
tables on which were inscribed the twenty-two laws of Romulus, termed by
many historians &ldquo;The Double Decalogue of Romulus.&rdquo; Article
XV of this law, as well as Articles IX and X, seem to be directed
against the life of these androgynes. In Roman history, however, we have
an event which would seem to contradict that there existed any laws in
actual force against this unfortunate class. It happened during the
existence of the Punic wars, when the people were more or less laboring
under fear and excitement, which would readily prepare them to accept
any superstitious notion. It was during these times that three of these
androgynes were known to exist in Italy. Titus Livius mentions that the
existence of one of these was denounced during the consulships of C.
Claudius Nero and of Marcus Livius. Etruscan soothsayers and seers were
summoned to Rome, that they might consult the signs and the conditions
of the constellations that accompanied the nativity of this
hermaphrodite, or androgyne. These impostors, after a careful
consultation of all attending circumstances, gave it as their opinion
that the occurrence was an unfortunate impurity, and that it could only
result to the disadvantage of Rome, unless she at once took steps to
purify herself of such a monstrosity, with the conclusion that the
androgyne should be first exiled from Roman soil, and then drowned in
the depths of the sea. The unfortunate being was accordingly inclosed in
a chest and put on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
board a galley, which put immediately to sea; when the vessel was out
of sight of land the chest was thrown into the Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>A hermaphrodite born in Umbria during the consulship of Messalus and C.
Lucinius was condemned to death, as well as was the one born at Luna
during the consulship of L. Matellus and Q. Fabius Maximus. Debierre
states that in the reign of Nero this barbarous custom was discontinued,
as this emperor admired these freaks of nature from their novelty, as it
is related that his chariot was drawn by four hermaphroditic horses.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>In connection with hermaphrodism it has been shown that the males who
have been supposed to be so malformed were really, in most instances,
but cases of hypospadias. It may not be uninteresting to observe that,
while during nearly four thousand years circumcision has been practiced
without the habit or condition ever having become transmissible or
hereditary, hypospadias has shown a decided tendency to being
transmitted. In Virchow&rsquo;s <i>Archives</i>, Lesser reports having
treated eight subjects during one generation in a family.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Fod&eacute;r&eacute; records the case of hypospadias reported by
Schweikard, in a person of forty-nine years of age, whose urethral
orifice was near the junction of the penis and scrotum, but who,
nevertheless, had three fine children. The same author records the
remarkable case reported by Hunter to the Royal Society of London, also
so deformed, who successfully impregnated his wife by receiving the
spermatic fluid in a warm spoon and immediately injecting it into the
vagina.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Another interesting case is taken from <i>L&rsquo;Union M&eacute;dicale</i>
of August 26, 1856. It instances both the heredity connected with
hypospadias and the peculiar circumstances under which impregnation at
times takes place; it is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
reported by Dr. Trexel, of Kremsier, and is as follows: &ldquo;On April
1, 1856, a newborn infant was brought to Dr. Trexel, that he might
determine its sex. The father and mother were servants of a peasant. On
an examination of the alleged father, he was found to have all the
external characters of a male; the urethra, which was rather shorter
than ordinary, but of large size, was imperforate; the scrotum was
divided into two pouches, each containing a testicle. The apposed
surfaces of the scrotal pouches were covered with a red skin, and the
division extended through their entire length. At the root of the penis,
in the anterior angle of these pouches, was an opening of the size of a
lentil; this was the orifice of the urethra. The lower surface of the
penis was grooved from the above-mentioned orifice to the end of the
glans. There was no prepuce. Almost in a line behind the corona of the
glans, and in the groove, were two elliptical openings, which readily
admitted a large hog-bristle; there was a third smaller opening two
lines from the orifice of the urethra. This man had always passed for a
woman. He lay in the same room with the mother of the child; and they
acknowledged having had frequent connection. The woman declared that she
had had no commerce with any other man for three years, and the man did
not deny this assertion. The idea of cohabitation with another man was
further negatived by the circumstance that the infant had the same
conformation of the genital organs as the father. How did fecundation
take place? The three openings in the penis were probably the orifices
of the excretory ducts of Cowper&rsquo;s glands. But might not these
have been the openings of the ejaculatory ducts? It is to be regretted
that Dr. Trexel did not examine these canals; their length and direction
would have thrown light on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the subject. The fact of fecundation may also be explained by supposing
that during coition the posterior wall of the vagina supplied the place
of the absent floor of the urethra, thus forming a complete canal. This
is the most probable explanation.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The above case, as stated, had passed for a woman; these cases are by no
means such rarities. The case of Marie Dorothee, mentioned by Debierre
in his work, was as peculiar. Hufeland and Marsina had pronounced Marie
a woman, while Stark and Martens pronounced her a man, and Metzger could
not determine on the sex. The case of Valmont, noticed by Bouillaud and
Manee, is on a par with that of Giraud, in which the party was married
as belonging to one sex and where it was not until after death
ascertained that the person belonged to the other sex. Valmont had a
hypospadic urethra and penis; a scrotum without testicles; ovaries with
the Fallopian tubes; a uterus opened into a vagina of two inches in
length, which, gradually narrowing, ended in the male urethra, to which
was attached a prostate gland. Valmont contracted marriage as a man and
was not discovered to have been a female until the autopsy revealed her
to be a woman. The relation does not state anything in regard to
menstruation; so that her condition in that regard is unknown.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>There has also been reported a number of cases in the male analogous to
the double organed female mentioned by Debierre. Geoffrey St. Hilare
reports a case where the penis was double, one being above the other,
urine and semen flowing through both urethras. Gor&egrave; mentioned a like
case to the Academy in 1844. Dr. Vanier (Du Havre) records the case
reported by Huguier to the Academy, where the organs in the anatomical
preparation which he exhibited were so anomalous <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
that it was impossible to decide the sex. Aside from the medico-legal
aspects that these cases present, there is an interesting Jewish
theological question connected with them. The law is explicit as to
circumcision; the cases presenting, if males, should be circumcised, but
how to determine the sex where an autopsy alone will decide the question
is not defined. It has been decided, in such cases where the presumption
is that the child is of the male sex, that, like in cases of absence of
prepuce, a suppositious circumcision should be performed, so that the
covenant should be observed; this being in keeping with the sentiment
shown by the Jews when persecuted by the Romans, or, later, by the
Spaniards, who often were not able to circumcise until after death; but
they never fail to comply with the covenant as far as it is possible.</p>

<p>Cases are liable to occur, however, which, without leaving the question
as to sex in doubt, if reasoned by exclusion, would not furnish any
possible opportunity for circumcision. Such a case is reported in
Virchow&rsquo;s <i>Archives</i>, vol. cxxi, No. 3; also in the <i>British
Medical Journal</i> of December 6, 1890, and in the <i>Satellite</i> for
January, 1891. It is one of congenital absence of penis. &ldquo;Dr.
Rauber records very briefly the case of a shoe-maker, aged 38, who
complained of pain and trouble in the anus. On examining him, Rauber
found a well-formed scrotum containing two testicles, each with a vas
deferens and spermatic cord, but no trace of a penis. The urethra opened
apparently into the anterior wall of the rectum. The man occasionally
experienced sexual excitement, followed by an emission into the rectum.
The burning pain complained of in the rectum and about the anus was due
to the irritation caused by the urine. The man would not allow an ocular
inspection <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of the interior of the rectum. Unfortunately, the details of this very
rare condition are incomplete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know where the seat of his sexual desire is
situated, unless an aching testicle is such. I once knew a Spiritualist
who claimed to feel the pains suffered by any friends with whom he was
in sympathy; he once tried to argue with me that a certain lady
patient&mdash;a warm personal friend of my questioner and a Spiritualist&mdash;had
ovaritis, because he felt an intense burning pain in his <i>right ovarian
region</i> whenever he went near to her. I tried to reason with him that
that pain should be in his right testicle, but he would insist on having
the sympathetic pain in <i>his</i> ovarian region.</p>

<span class='sc sf75'>Religio Medici.</span></h2>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne, in his &ldquo;Religio Medici,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
alludes to the scandal that is generally attached to our profession, we
being accused of professing no religion. That this opinion is still
prevalent at the present day is undeniable,&mdash;philosophers and
physicians are believed to be atheists and
non-religionists,&mdash;while, at the same time, by that strange
contradiction that is so common, philosophers and physicians are the
known and recognized sources of religions, such is the intimate relation
existing between physical and moral hygiene. Confucius, the contemporary
of Pythagoras, whose religion was said to be nothing more than the
observance of a certain moral and political ethical code, and he who
first formulated the text &ldquo;that one should do unto others as one
wishes others to do unto him,&rdquo; the founder of the Confucian
religion, the orthodox religion of China, was a philosopher. Buddha, the
founder of the second creed recognized in China, and which forms the
religion of a great part of eastern Asia, was also a philosopher who was
endeavoring to reduce the Brahminical religion to the simple principles
of philosophical religion, based on morality. Moses not only was the
greatest philosopher of his time, but also had an insight into medicine
that to us of the present day is simply incomprehensible. The Great
Master was both a philosopher and a physician, his disputes with the
learned and his attention to the sick having given him the titles of
Great Master and Divine Healer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
To use the words of the &ldquo;Religio Medici,&rdquo; the great body of
the medical profession can, without usurpation, assume the name of
Christians; for no monk of the desert convents of Asia Minor or
religious knight of the middle ages, either in their care of the sick,
or giving food and shelter to the weary, or protection of sword and
shield to the oppressed pilgrim plodding his way to the Holy Land, were
more deserving of the name of Christian than the medical man unwearily
and unselfishly practicing his profession. To the true student of his
art there is that in medicine which makes of the physician a practical
Christian. Nor is there aught in medicine, either in its traditions,
history, study, or practice, that in the lover of his art should ever
make him anything but a philosophical and practical religionist. The
physician, such as is actively engaged in the daily practice of his
profession, instead of having no religion, is really a practical
religionist, and, although he may subscribe to no outer ceremonial form
or dogma, his life is such that a Confucian, a Buddhist, a Christian, or
a Hebrew can behold in him the practitioner of the essence of either of
their religions,&mdash;a conception carried out by Lessing, in his play
of &ldquo;Nathan the Wise,&rdquo; where the Jew, the Saracen, and
Crusader teach the impressive lesson that nobleness is bound by no
confession of faith or religion; showing the principle that should guide
true religion.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Townsend, of Boston University, has given a very
interesting and intelligent relation of the connections that exist
between medicine and the Old Testament, in the light of
nineteenth-century science.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>

class='sc lc'>B.C.</span> and 320 <span class='sc lc'>B.C.</span>, or the philosophic era of medicine,
during which flourished the father of our present system of medicine, an
era of advancement, but which in our eyes is still full of errors and
unscientific conclusions. From these two periods we span over centuries
of darkness for science and medicine to the ages of Ambroise Par&eacute;
and the more modern fathers of our art, who by perseverance finally
extricated medicine from the mass of magical and superstitious rubbish
which, like barnacles, had clung to it during its passage through the
dark and ignorant ages. After this review our author turns to the Bible
and discourses in this wise:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turning our attention to the Bible, we take the position that,
though it was not designed to teach the science of medicine, still,
whenever by hint, explicit statement, or commandment there is found in
it anything relating to medicine, disease, or sanitary regulation, there
must be no error; that is, provided the Bible, in an exceptional sense,
is God&rsquo;s book. Now, what are the facts in this case? They are
these: though the Bible often speaks of disease and remedy, yet the
illusions, deceptions, and gross errors of anatomy, physiology, and
pathology, as formerly taught, nowhere appear upon its pages. This, it
must be acknowledged, is at least singular. But more than this: the
various hints and directions of the Bible, its sanitary regulations, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
isolation of the sick, the washing, the sprinkling, the external
applications, and the various moral and religious injunctions in their
bearing upon health are confessed to be in harmony with what is most
recent and approved. To be sure, the average old-school physician of a
century ago would have blandly smiled at our simplicity, had it been
suggested to him that his methods would be improved by following Bible
hints. &lsquo;What did Moses know about medical science?&rsquo; would
have been his reply. But Moses, judged by recent standards, seems to
have known much, or, at least, to have written well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The above statement is a truthful relation of facts, from which it can
well be conceived that even in the Bible the physician finds something
to inspire him with the idea of its divine inspiration, as the very
history of medicine, with which it is connected, and with which he is
familiar, only lends him further support in that direction. Most
intelligent physicians are also lovers of philosophical history. None is
more entertaining than Rawlinson, either in his &ldquo;Seven Great
Monarchies&rdquo; or his &ldquo;Ancient Egypt.&rdquo; In his
&ldquo;Ancient Religions,&rdquo; in his concluding remarks, he observes
as follows, in regard to the Hebraic religion: &ldquo;It seems
impossible to trace back to any one fundamental conception, to any
innate idea, or to any common experience or observation, the various
religions which we have been considering. The veiled monotheism of
Egypt, the dualism of Persia, the shamanism of Etruria, the pronounced
polytheism of India are too contrariant to admit of any one explanation,
or to be derivative of one single source.... It is clear that from none
of the religions here treated of could the religion of the ancient
Hebrews have originated. The Israelite people, at different periods
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of its history, came and remained for a considerable time under
Egyptian, Babylonian, and Persian influence, and there have not been
wanting persons of ability who have regarded Judaism as a mere offshoot
of the religion of one or the other of these three peoples. But, with
the knowledge that we have now obtained of the religions in question,
such views have been regarded as untenable, if not henceforth
impossible. Judaism stands out from all other ancient religions as a
thing <i>sui generis</i>, offering the sharpest contrast to the systems
prevalent in the rest of the East, and so entirely different from them
in its essence that its origin could not but have been distinct and
separate.... The sacred books of the Hebrews cannot possibly have been
derived from the sacred writings of any of these nations. No contrast
can be greater than that between the Pentateuch and the &lsquo;Ritual of
the Dead,&rsquo; unless it be that between the Pentateuch and the
Zendavesta, or between the same work and the Vedas.... In most religions
the monotheistic idea is most prominent <i>at the first</i>, and gradually
becomes obscured, and gives way before a polytheistic corruption....
Altogether, the theory to which the facts appear on the whole to point
is the existence of a primitive religion, communicated to man from
without, whereof monotheism and expiatory sacrifice were parts, and the
gradual clouding over of this principle everywhere, unless it were among
the Hebrews.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Medicine is indebted for its advancement to the Hebraic religion to a
greater extent than is generally believed. In the early Christian
centuries there existed three great creeds: the Christian, Hebraic, and
Mohammedan. The Christian Church was in a perplexing condition. As
observed by Draper,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
it was impossible <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to disentangle her from the principles which had, at the beginning,
entered into her political organization. For good or evil, right or
wrong, her necessity required that she should put herself forth as the
possessor of all knowledge within the reach of the human intellect. But
the monk and priest were prohibited from studying medicine,<a
name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
as by so doing the church saw that she would have to relinquish the
spiritual control of disease were medicine a matter of scientific
research; she preferred to hold on to her spiritual dominion, and let
science slumber in darkness. On the other hand, the Mohammedans,
recognizing the principle of fatalism in their religion, it was not to
be expected that they should cultivate an art entirely opposed to that
principle. In this state of affairs the Jewish physician, led by the
teachings of his religion, alone presented the study of medicine in a
scientific manner, and its practice and its result taught the Moslems
that medical science placed it within the power of man to keep himself
out of the grave, when either assailed by disease or laid low by the
wounds of war. The Arabs were not slow to avail themselves of this
discovery; and to the learning and skill of the Jewish physician, guided
by the light of an intelligent Deity and a liberal religion, does
medicine owe the existence of those able and learned Arabian physicians
that flourished during the eleventh and twelfth centuries.</p>

<p>There has been more or less of fault-finding in regard to certain rules
and ordinances being sacramental, which, from the nature of things,
should have been merely advisory or suggestive, as they pertained more
to the hygienic welfare of the people than to the spiritual. Thus to
reason, is neither philosophical nor in concert with our knowledge of
the structure of man, and of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
intimate relations that exist between mind and body, or of good health
and good morals. The writer has seen violent catharsis produced by bread
pills, after podophyllin, castor-oil, and phosphate of soda in the most
generous doses&mdash;administered as one would drop a letter in a
mail-box&mdash;had completely failed; it is all in the manner and way we
give a medicine or treat a disease. Certain narcotic and irritant
poisons or powerful sedative agents have a physical action uninfluenced
by the mind, but an intelligent physician is hardly supposed to drive at
the small tack of disease with such powerful sledge-hammers. Charcot,
recognizing the power of and availing himself of such a remedial agent
as the pilgrimages to the Notre Dame de Lourdes, is an evidence of the
intelligent and enlightened practitioner, who has learned, what the
Bible taught, long, long ago, that human nature must be taken as it is
found, and that, like the homely saying of Mohammed, as the mountain
would not come to him, he must go to the mountain. Moses and all the
Scriptural writers were well aware of this state of affairs, and their
manner of using their knowledge was adapted and timed to the general
intellectual development of the times.</p>

<p>There is one point in connection with the above that should not escape
our attention, this being that, while the Hebraic creed and the people
still subscribed to the theological doctrine of the origin of disease,
in common with the religions then in vogue, here the connection stopped.
All other creeds&mdash;not excepting Christianity&mdash;looked forward to a
theological doctrine of the cure of disease. With the Hebrew, disease
was looked upon as the result of some infraction on his part of some of
the laws, and the consequent expression of displeasure on the part of
the Deity. He was taught, however, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that the observance of certain ordinances were both conducive to health
and to the prevention of disease, and acceptable to God, as well as to
rely upon his study and skill to cure disease. This was equivalent to
teaching them that diseases arose from physical causes, and that
physical means were to be used to combat them. From this arose the
practice of exposing the sick in public places, that they might receive
the benefit of the advice of such who might have had experience in a
like case. It is from their religion that Hebraic medicine has received
its foundation of intelligent philosophy that carried it in its purity
through all ages, free from magic, superstition, and imposture. With
other creeds and religions, medicine, disease, as well as the physical
phenomena affecting nature, were believed to be the arbitrary expression
of anger of their gods, and that the cure of disease, or alterations in
physical phenomena, were to be as arbitrarily effected, regardless of
the existence or action of physical laws. It is to be regretted that one
of the sects which has sprung from the Hebraic creed, and which worships
the same God, has been unable to emancipate itself or its people from
the idea of an arbitrary theological doctrine of the origin and control
of disease. It is this creation of a narrow-minded theology of a
vaccilating, unintelligent, unphilosophical, and arbitrary God, who
would neither respect nor regard the laws of his own creation, that has
led the great body of physicians out of the modern churches. They do not
deny the existence of the Deity, but the god of their conception is a
higher and nobler god,&mdash;the Deity of Religio Medici.</p>

among whom we may mention Sir Charles Bell, Dr. John Kidd, Dr. Peter M.
Roget, and Dr. William Prout,&mdash;not only won on their own merit, but
in competition with learned theologians and noted divines,&mdash;we may
truly say that physicians are by no means atheists or agnostics, but
that, on the contrary, they are the real exponents of a practical and
intelligent religion, which they not only practice, but fully and
intelligently comprehend.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>Hebraic Circumcision.</span></h2>

<p>The first mention that we meet concerning circumcision is in Genesis. It
is the command of God to Abraham; in establishing the covenant with him,
He said to him: &ldquo;This is my covenant, which ye shall keep between
me and you, and thy seed after thee: every man-child among you shall be
circumcised. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it
shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you&rdquo; (Gen. xvii,
10, 11). It was also ordained that this should be extended to servants
belonging to Abraham and his seed, as well as to their own children; and
that in case of children it should be done on the eighth day after
birth.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
This was appointed as an ordinance of perpetual obligation on the
Hebraic family, and its neglect or omission entailed being cut off from
the people (12, 14). In compliance with this ordinance, Abraham,
although in his ninety-ninth year, circumcised himself and all his
slaves, as well as his son Ishmael. Slaves by purchase were
circumcised,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
as were any strangers, who were also circumcised before being allowed to
partake of the passover or to become Jewish citizens. It was to be
observed by all heathens who became converted to the Jewish faith.
During the wanderings in the wilderness circumcision was not practiced,
but Joshua caused all to be circumcised before they entered the promised
land.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The old Hebrews strictly followed the injunction to circumcise on the
eighth day, and of such importance in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a religious sense was this rite in their estimation that even when the
eighth day fell on the Sabbath the eighth day ordinance was observed.
The ordinance, however, was not blindly arbitrary, as rules were laid
down for exception. For instance, whenever a family had lost two
children through circumcision it did not become obligatory on that
family to circumcise the third child, who was however considered as
entitled to all the benefits of the congregation or of the Hebraic
religion, just the same as if he had been circumcised. Again,
Maimonides, or Moussa Ben Maimon, a celebrated physician and rabbi, born
in Cordova in the year 1135 <span class='sc lc'>A.D.</span>, among his works on medicine, has left
directions in regard to circumcision which have been the guides of the
<i>mohels</i>. Among the Hebraic physicians it was considered that the child
partook of the constitutional strength or feebleness of the mother;
hence the rule above mentioned, in regard to exemption to circumcision,
only was in operation when the two who had formerly died belonged to the
same mother as the third one, who would thereby be exempt; but if the
two children had belonged to another woman, and this third child of the
father was not from the same mother, the rule did not exempt. The third
child of the mother who had previously lost two infants at the rite was,
however, to be circumcised when arrived at adult age, provided no
further counter-indication occurred. The opinion that the mother gave
the constitution to the child was promulgated by Maimonides and became
general.</p>

<p>The eighth day is believed to refer to the eighth day after full term;
thus, a child born prematurely is not supposed to be circumcised until
eight days after it would have reached its full term, and only then if
its general good condition is settled. Maimonides looked <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
upon infantile jaundice, general debility, and marasmus as
contra-indications to the performance of the rite; any erysipelatous
inflammation, ophthalmia, an&aelig;mia, eruption of any kind, fever,
tendency to convulsive movements&mdash;in fact, any observable departure
from normal health should be allowed to pass before performing the rite.
Aside from these general conditions that denoted that the operation was
contra-indicated, the local condition of the organ itself also was to be
examined, and if certain conditions existed the operation was to be put
off. These conditions consisted in any irritation or red appearance of
the prepuce, due to either inflammation or to the irritative action of
the sebaceous matter underneath the prepuce, the acrid nature of these
secretions being at times sufficiently virulent to produce an
ulceration, even in the newborn.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Among the Hebrews themselves there are those who do not look upon
circumcision in a favorable light, but on something that has served its
time in its own day, and within the past year a proselyte has been
accepted into one of the New York synagogues without previous or
subsequent circumcision, these reformed Jews looking upon adult
circumcision as too painful an operation to be gone through, as they
claim, unnecessarily. It must be said, however, that these persons look
upon circumcision purely in a sacramental light, and simply as an
arbitrary ordinance of God in the remote ages of antiquity, but which in
the present century has not enough practical significance to warrant its
performance on the occasion of an adult joining the congregation. These
persons look upon it, as has been said, in a purely theological light,
and ignore any and all considerations of hygiene in connection with it,
claiming that if it is a simple matter of hygiene, then it is not a
sacrament, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and that, if it is sacramental, then the subject of hygiene has nothing
whatever to do with it. The force of their reasoning and logic is very
obscure and clouded, to say the least. The covenant either exists or it
does not; to do away with one ordinance in any arbitrary manner is to
gradually begin to crumble down the whole fabric of Judaism; for when
exceptions are begun, one tenet as well as another is liable to topple
over. If the rite is a sacrament, then it should be performed on all,
and a proselyte should not be admitted without being circumcised, and,
if a hygienic measure only, the same rule holds. These Jews evidently
ignore the rationalism that governed the promulgation of the Mosaic law,
and its recognition of the inseparability of the moral from the physical
nature of man.</p>

<p>Montaigne has left us a description of the performance of the rite, as
witnessed by him in the city of Rome in the sixteenth century. He
relates it as follows: &ldquo;On the thirtieth of January was witnessed
one of the most ancient ceremonies of religion practiced by mankind,
this being the circumcision of the Jews. This is performed at the
dwelling, the most commodious chamber being chosen for the occasion. At
this particular time, by reason of the incommodity of the house, the
rite was performed at the door of the domicile. The godfather sat
himself on a table, with a pillow on his lap. The godmother then brought
the child, after which she retired. The godfather then undressed the
child&rsquo;s lower part so as to expose his person, while the operator
and his assistant began to chant hymns. This operation lasts at least a
quarter of an hour. The operator may or may not be a rabbi, as it is
considered a great blessing to perform this operation; so that it
follows that many are found who are anxious to exercise their faculty in
this <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
regard, there being a tradition that those who have circumcised a
certain number do not suffer putrefaction in their mouth, nor does their
mouth become food for worms after death; so that it often happens that
they make presents of value to the child for the privilege of operating
upon it. On the same table on which the godfather is seated all the
required instruments and apparatus are placed, while an assistant stands
by with a flask of wine and a glass. A warming-pan full of coals is on
the floor, at which the operator warms his hands. The child being now
ready, with its head toward the godfather, the operator, seizing the
member, draws the foreskin toward him with one hand, while with the
fingers of the other he pushes back the glans; he then places a silver
instrument, which fixes the skin, and which at the same time holds back
the glans so that the knife may not cut it. The foreskin is then cut off
and buried in the little basin of soil that forms one of the
appurtenances to the operation. The operator then tears with his nails
the skin which lies on the glans, which he turns back over the body of
the member. This seems the hardest and most painful part of the
operation, which, however, does not seem dangerous, as in four or five
days the wound has healed. The crying of the child resembles that of an
infant undergoing baptism. No sooner is the glans uncovered than the
operator takes a mouthful of wine; he then places the glans in his mouth
and sucks the blood out of it; this he repeats three times. This done,
he applies a powder of dragons&rsquo; blood, with which he covers up all
the wound, the parts being then done up in expressly-cut bandages. He is
then given a glass of wine, over which he says some prayers; of this he
takes a mouthful, and, after moistening his fingers in the same, he
applies the wine three times to the child&rsquo;s mouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
The wine is then sent to the mother and the women, who are in some
other apartment, who all take a sip. An assistant then takes a silver
instrument, pierced with little holes like a small strainer, which he
first applies to the nose of the officiating minister, then to that of
the child, and afterward to the nose of the godfather.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
The above description of the performance of the rite in the sixteenth
century answers to the method of its performance as was witnessed some
years ago in France.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical
Cyclop&aelig;dia&rdquo; of Drs. McClintock and Strong the following
description of the rite, as taking place in our modern synagogues, is
given:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ceremony of circumcision, as practiced by the Jews in our own
times, is thus: If the eighth day happens to be on the Sabbath, the
ceremony must be performed on that day, notwithstanding its sanctity.
When a male child is born the godfather is chosen from amongst his
relatives or near friends; and if the party is not in circumstances to
bear the expenses, which are considerable (for after the ceremony is
performed a breakfast is provided, even amongst the poor, in a luxurious
manner), it is usual for the poor to get one amongst the richer, who
accepts the office, and becomes a godfather. There are also societies
formed amongst them for the purpose of defraying the expenses, and every
Jew receives the benefit if his child is born in wedlock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ceremony is performed in the following manner, in general:
The circumciser being provided with a very sharp instrument called the
circumcising-knife, plasters, cummin-seeds to dress the wound, proper
bandages, etc., the child is brought to the door of the synagogue by the
godmother, when the godfather receives it from her and carries it into
the synagogue, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
where a large chair with two seats is placed; the one is for the
godfather to sit upon, the other is called the seat of Elijah the
Prophet, who is called the angel or messenger of the covenant. As soon
as the godfather enters with the child, the congregation say,
&lsquo;Blessed is he that cometh to be circumcised, and enter into the
covenant on the eighth day.&rsquo; The godfather being seated, and the
child placed on a cushion in his lap, the circumciser performs the
operation, and, holding the child in his arms, takes a glass of wine
into his right hand, and says as follows: &lsquo;Blessed be Thou, O Lord
our God, King of the Universe, Creator of the fruit of the vine! Blessed
art Thou, O Lord our God! who hath sanctified His beloved from the womb,
and ordained an ordinance for His kindred, and sealed His descendants
with the mark of His holy covenant; therefore, for the merits of this, O
living God! our rock and inheritance, command the deliverance of the
beloved of our kindred from the pit, for the sake of the covenant which
He hath put in our flesh. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, the Maker of the
Covenant! our God, and the God of our fathers! Preserve this child to
his father and mother, and his name shall be called in Israel, A, the
son of B. Let the father rejoice in those that go forth from his loins,
and let his mother be glad in the fruit of her womb, as it is written:
&ldquo;Thy father and mother shall rejoice, and they that begat thee
shall be glad.&rdquo;&rsquo; The father of the child then says the
following grace: &lsquo;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the
Universe! who hath sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us
to enter into the covenant of our holy father, Abraham.&rsquo; The
congregation answer: &lsquo;As he hath entered into the law, the canopy,
and the good and virtuous deeds.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>Mezizah, the Fourth or Objectionable Act of Suction.</span></h2>

<p>Biblical and rabbinical traditions throw no light on the origin of the
details of the operation as now performed. That it was anciently
performed with a knife of stone is certain; an event common in its
general observance, and which seems to have pervaded all nations or
races, howsoever remote or scattered, that it has induced Tylor<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
to ascribe the origin of the rite to the stone age. We are told that
when Moses was returning to the land of Egypt he had neglected
circumcising his son, and that because of that neglect he nearly lost
his son&rsquo;s life; his wife, Zipporah, the daughter of the Midian
king and priest, Jethro, seeing the danger and knowing its cause, took
her little son Gershom and circumcised him with a stone knife, and
offered the foreskin to God as a peace-offering. Just where the wine was
first used we are not told. Wine, however, was an emblem of
thanksgiving, and, being one of the fruits of the earth, was considered
an acceptable offering to God. It has since, in some form or other,
either as wine or as the representative of either divine or human blood,
been used in both the Catholic and Protestant Churches in their
ceremonials or vicarious sacrifices, or imitations of old customs.
Circumcision was by many connected with a blood sacrifice; it was so
suggested by the words of Zipporah at the circumcision of Gershom:
&ldquo;And Zipporah, his Midianitish wife, took up a sharp stone and cut
off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet and said,
&lsquo;Surely <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a <i>Khathan</i> of blood art thou to me.&rsquo;&rdquo; Much speculation has
followed the use of this word <i>Khathan</i>, which, in the ordinary Arabian,
may mean either husband or son-in-law; it also means a newly-admitted
member of a family; a similar word means &ldquo;to provide a wedding
feast,&rdquo; and one other word from the same root and branch means
&ldquo;to give or receive a daughter in marriage.&rdquo; In our own day,
the <i>mohel</i>, or ministerial circumciser, makes it a practice to draw a
little blood from the skin of such as are presented for the rite, but
whom nature has not furnished with sufficient foreskin for the
operation. The application, thrice repeated, of the blood and wine to
the lips of the child, is probably used as a sign of the sealing of the
compact. Wine is mentioned in connection with the High-Priest
Melchisedeck as the wine of thanksgiving at his meeting with Abraham;
wine was presented to Aaron by the angel, who, giving him a crystal
glassful of good wine, said to him: &ldquo;Aaron, drink of this wine
which the Lord sends you as a pledge of good news.&rdquo; Originally,
circumcision must have consisted of the simple removal of the foreskin,
and the elaboration of the ceremonial details must have been a
subsequent occurrence; persons wounding their fingers will instinctively
carry them to their mouth, and it may be that the suction practiced by
the Hebrews had its origin in this natural h&aelig;mostatic suggestion.
Wine as a h&aelig;mostatic and as an emblem of thanksgiving and an
acceptable offering naturally came in as an accessory.</p>

<p>This practice&mdash;which, in the old, patriarchal days of the simple
shepherds, when men only lived on the flesh of their own flocks, their
diet, however, consisting mostly of cakes of flour, milk, honey, a few
herbs, or the flesh of the goat or sheep&mdash;could not have been as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
objectionable as it is at the present day, with blood and secretions in
a continued ferment through diet and habits. Man, living in the open air
of Armenia, Palestine, or Arabia, sleeping in the open tents of our
Biblical forefathers, living on the simple diet of a shepherd&rsquo;s
camp, with the abstemiousness that those climates naturally induce in
man, could not help but be healthy. In those early days, when neither
passion, anxiety, nor worry disturbed either digestion or sleep, man had
no vitiated secretions, wine was then a rarity, and water was the drink.
One of the early patriarchs on such diet would have furnished a dainty
and savory dish to the most fastidious cannibal, who is now tormented by
the <i>komerborg kawan</i>, this being a term used by the Australian
cannibals to designate the peculiar nausea that is induced in them when
they recklessly eat of white man,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>&mdash;something
which they do not experience from feasting on the savages who live on
the simple diet of a pastoral tribe. This primitive gastronomic science
in regard to cannibalism even reached such a pitch of refinement that,
as has been previously mentioned, some tribes even resorted to
emasculation to improve the flavor of the animal juices, which by this
procedure became less acrid. The Arabian and Oriental traditions bring
us down tales of how, on the same principles, human beings intended to
grace the festive platter were fed exclusively on rice. The salivary and
buccal secretions, under such a simple diet as that indulged in by our
Biblical forefathers, become bland and harmless; not only harmless, but
even antiseptic and positively beneficial, acting on the same principle
as local applications of pepsin. So that the practice, at the time of
the patriarchs and in their own family, of this part of the rite could
not have offered the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
same objection that it does at the present day. The modern
house-dweller, living on a mixed diet and in a climate that induces him
to eat grossly, both as to quality and quantity, partaking more or less
of vinous, spirituous, or fermented liquors, as well as indulging in
tobacco, is quite another being from the Arabian or Armenian shepherd of
former days. Business anxieties and worry also have a very pronounced
effect; so that, with the change in the conditions of man and the
inception and multiplication of diseased conditions, as well as the
creation of constitutional and transmissible diseases, this practice of
suction should have been stopped.</p>

<p>Intelligent rabbis, devoted to their religion, are necessarily prone to
defend any of the details in its ceremonials that age and practice have
sanctioned, and even some of the later writings of Israelism seem to
make the mezizah, or suction, a necessary and ceremonial detail. In the
&ldquo;Guimara,&rdquo; composed in the fifth century, Rabbi Rav Pop&egrave;
uses these words: &ldquo;All operators who fail to use suction, and
thereby cause the infant to run any risk, should be destituted of the
right to perform the ceremony.&rdquo; In the &ldquo;Mishna&rdquo; it
says, &ldquo;It is permitted on the Sabbath to do all that is necessary
to perform circumcision, excision, denudation, and suction.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;Mishna&rdquo; was composed during the second century. The
celebrated Maimonides lent it his sanction, as in his work on
circumcision he advises suction, to avoid any subsequent danger. Our
modern Israelites are supposed, as a rule, to have taken their
authority, aside from previous usage and custom, from the &ldquo;Beth
Yosef,&rdquo; which was written by Joseph Karo, and subsequently
annotated by the Rabbi Israel Isserth. In all of these sanctions,
however, there is no reason expressed why it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
should be performed.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
Maimonides undoubtedly looked upon this act as having a decided tendency
or action in depleting the immediate vessels in the vicinity of the cut
surface, and that the consequent constriction in their calibre would
prevent any future h&aelig;morrhage. That this is the natural result of
suction is a fact readily understood by any modern physician. The
depletion of the vessel for some distance in its length, with the
contraction in the coat that follows, is certainly a better preventive
to consequent h&aelig;morrhage than the simple application of any
styptic preparation that can only be placed at the mouth of the vessel,
but which leaves its calibre intact. Hot water, or an extreme degree of
cold, will answer to produce this contraction and depletion, but there
is here a local physical reaction that is more liable to occur than when
the contraction has taken place naturally, as when induced by depletion,
instead of by the stimulus of either heat or cold. So that if, in the
light of modern civilization and changed conditions of mankind, and the
existence of diseases which formerly did not exist, we are now convinced
that suction is dangerous, we should not judge the ancients too hastily
or rashly for having adopted the custom, as it is certainly not without
some scientific merit; although, authorities are not wanting who hold
that suction or depletion increases the danger of h&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<p>It can be understood that the results of suction would be in some
measure analogous to those left by the application of an Esmarch bandage
on a limb. The ancients, performing the operation with rude implements
and having no h&aelig;mostatic remedies or appliances, naturally followed the
best means at their command; they evidently feared h&aelig;morrhage, and their
rule in regard to exemption shows us that they recognized the existence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of h&aelig;morrhagic diathesis or other transmissible peculiarities of
constitution. This same fear of h&aelig;morrhage probably suggested the
second step of the operation being performed, as it is by laceration
instead of by cutting instruments, showing in this an evident desire to
limit the cutting part of the operation to as small a limit as possible.
Against an infant who has decided h&aelig;morrhagic tendency, we are
about as helpless as were the ancient Hebrews, and, while the Turkish or
some of the Arabian methods of performing the operation may be said in
ordinary cases&mdash;by the application of cord and the consequent
constriction&mdash;to limit the danger from subsequent h&aelig;morrhage,
still, in the h&aelig;morrhagic diathesis this would not be of any
avail; so, as already observed, we must not too rashly judge those old
shepherds of the Armenian plains for adopting a practice which to them
was calculated to avert subsequent dangers, or their descendants
following in their footsteps, until having learned better, even if that
practice is to us disgusting, primitive, and useless.</p>

<p>Cases occur,&mdash;happily not frequently,&mdash;of alarming and uncontrollable
h&aelig;morrhage. The following case is suggestive of the alarming extent and
persistence that may attend one of those h&aelig;morrhagic cases, even when
recovery eventually takes place. It is reported by Dr. Sannanel in the
<i>Gazetta Toscana delle science medicale e fisiche</i> of 1844. The case was
that of a Jewish infant circumcised on the eighth day. Some hours after
the operation the child was observed to be bleeding; the h&aelig;mmorrhage
would only cease for a few moments, and then come on with increased
force, and which proved rebellious to ordinary remedies. Dr. Sannanel
was called during the night of the third day after the operation. A
number of physicians had been in attendance, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and neither ice, astringents, pressure, nor any usual h&aelig;mostatic
means had had the least effect; cautery with nitrate of silver,
sulphuric acid, and the actual cautery by means of heated iron were
tried in succession, without any good results. Ten days passed in this
manner, the h&aelig;mmorrhage only ceasing for a few moments at a time,
and the child was nearly exsanguinated from the continued serous seepage
and the paroxysmal h&aelig;morrhages, when a lucky application of
caustic potassa almost immediately stopped the h&aelig;morrhage. This
case was seen by nearly all the leading medical men of Leghorn, who lent
their aid and counsel to save the little life. The case is interesting
from the length of time it persisted, and that even after all the loss
of blood and suffering that the little fellow endured he survived.<a
name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Epstein, of Cincinnati, in a letter of March 29, 1872, to the
<i>Israelite</i> of that city, mentions a nearly fatal case from h&aelig;morrage
after the rite of &ldquo;<i>Milah</i>,&rdquo; and gives the result of his
experience in such cases. He argues that <i>Hitouch</i> or <i>Hitooch</i> alone,
or the first step or cutting off of the prepuce, performed with ordinary
care, could hardly be followed up with any more serious results than can
be controlled with the application of a little acidulated water. The
second act, or <i>Periah</i>, the act of laceration, he looks upon as one
that calls for coolness, judgment, and skill, as the membrane should
only be torn so far and no farther, the thin, inner fold of the prepuce
being vascular only in the sulcus back of the corona and at its lower
attachment, where it forms the frenum, or bridle; any carelessness or
over-anxiety on the part of the operator in tearing this membrane too
far back results in danger of h&aelig;morrhage; especially is this part of the
operation liable to be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
badly done if the inner preputial fold is thick and resisting, as in
that case undue force may carry the laceration back into the vascular
tissue. The means suggested by Dr. Epstein to arrest h&aelig;morrhage
are those ordinarily used in h&aelig;morrhagic cases, such as will be
given presently. The doctor regrets that the operators are not as they
should be, physicians, and that, when <i>mohels</i> are employed, persons are
not sufficiently exacting as to their qualifications.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>In France the government has managed to secure more safety in the
operation. By a royal decree of date of May 25, 1845, in compliance with
a desire expressed by the Hebrew Consistory, it was ordered that no one
should exercise the functions of a <i>mohel</i> or of <i>schohet</i>, without
being duly authorized to perform said functions by the Consistory of the
Circonscription; and that all <i>mohels</i> and <i>schohets</i> shall be governed
in the exercise of their functions by the Departmental Consistory and
the General Consistory. By virtue of this decree a regulation was passed
by the Consistories on the 12th of July, 1854, ordering that thereafter
circumcision should only be performed in a rational manner, and by a
properly qualified person. Suction was likewise abolished, and the wound
directed to be sponged with wine and water. This decree and the
resulting regulations have been of the greatest benefit to the French
Israelites, and some attention to the matter would not be amiss in the
United States.</p>

<p>This reformation has met with the approval of the leading French Jews,
whose General Consistory decided that suction was not necessarily a part
of the religious rite, and that, as it was undoubtedly introduced into
the rite on the days of primitive surgery, it was perfectly rational to
suppress this operative accessory, now <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that that same science, in its enlightenment, pronounced it unsafe. The
whole body of the Congregation did not tamely submit to what they
considered an innovation, and from some of the mohels all possible
resistance was opposed to prevent the abolishment of this part of the
operation from becoming a law. So determined was this opposition in some
instances that the Consistory of Paris found it necessary to impose on
all the mohels an obligation, bound by an oath, that they would respect
the law. Those who refused to take the obligation gave up their
vocation.</p>

<p>The Grand Rabbi of Paris, at the time of this reformation, M. Ennery,
was one of the most zealous supporters of the new departure. The
influence of the French pervaded northward, and the <i>mezizah</i> was
abolished in Brunswick, Dr. Solomon, a learned Hebrew of that State,
being instrumental in having it done legally. The discussion of this
subject, in 1845, had one very happy effect,&mdash;the supporters of the
reformed idea of the rite issued a circular letter to all the leading
continental surgeons and medical men asking for their opinion on several
points in relation thereto, especially, however, on this part of the
rite. The opinions of many of these will be referred to in the medical
part of this work.</p>

<p>The after-treatment of the circumcised infant is governed more or less
by local habits and the individual intelligence of the mohel and his
experience. After turning back the inner fold of the prepuce, the parts
are covered with a small, square bandage, with an aperture to admit the
passage of the glans. This, and the subsequent small bandage of old
linen, which is calculated to hold it in place, are slightly coated with
a powder composed of lycopodium, with the slight <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
addition, at times, of Monsel&rsquo;s salts, alum-powder, or some
vegetable astringent. Over these another compress is placed, to prevent
the friction of the clothes of the infant or of the bedding. The infant
then receives a final benediction, and the godmother then receives the
child in her arms and carries it to its cot or crib. The operator
generally visits the infant in the afternoon of the operation, and
carefully inspects the dressings, to see that no h&aelig;morrhage has
supervened.</p>

<p>It is customary to place the child in a bath, either the same evening or
on the following morning, the object of this being to remove and to
facilitate the removal of the dressings, which are more or less
saturated and clotted with blood. After the removal of these, the wound
is redressed, as previously, except that some cerate&mdash;ointment of roses
or some other mild ointment&mdash;is used. Some prefer the simple water
dressing from beginning to end. Since the introduction of creasote, acid
ph&eacute;nique, and carbolic acid, many mohels are in the practice of washing
the parts with water impregnated with one of these before performing the
operation, and using subsequently the same form of lotion at every
dressing. In case of h&aelig;morrhage there is an h&aelig;mostatic water or lotion,
which has been long used by the German and Polish mohels with
considerable success, and which, in ordinary cases, has been found to be
all that was required. This water, called by the French &ldquo;Mixture
d&rsquo;arguesbusade,&rdquo; &ldquo;Eau vulneraire spiriteuse de
Theden,&rdquo; and by the Germans as &ldquo;Spritzwasser&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Schusswasser,&rdquo; is composed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Acetic acid,</td><td align='right'>10</td><td align='center'>grammes.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Rectified spirits of wine,</td><td align='right'>5</td><td align='center'>&rdquo;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Diluted sulphuric acid,</td><td align='right'>2½</td><td align='center'>&rdquo;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Clarified honey,</td><td align='right'>8</td><td align='center'>&rdquo;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
This mixture is well mixed and filtered, and is then kept in a
tightly-stoppered vial.</p>

<p>Dr. Bergson uses a mixture composed of diluted sulphuric acid, 1 part;
alcohol, 3 parts; honey, 2 parts; and 6 parts of wine vinegar.</p>

<p>H&aelig;mostatic powders are also used by the Hebrews, being more conveniently
kept or carried than the h&aelig;mostatic waters. In Russia and in Poland they
are composed of decomposed or decayed hawthorn-wood powder and
lycopodium. That of Berlin is composed of Armenian bole, red clay,
dragons&rsquo; blood, powdered rose-leaves, powdered galls, and powdered
subcarbonate of lead. In France a h&aelig;mostatic fluid, composed of
dragons&rsquo; blood digested in turpentine, is in vogue. The Eau de
Pagliari is also used; it is composed of a mixture of tincture of
benzoin, 8 ounces; powdered alum, 1 pound; and 10 pounds of water,
boiled together for six hours, and is considered a powerful styptic. In
addition to these, burnt linen, spiders&rsquo; webs, starch-powder,
powdered alum, and plaster-of-Paris powder are used by different mohels.
Touching the bleeding points with a pointed pencil of nitrate of silver
is also a practice understood by the Jewish circumcisers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>What are the Benefits of Circumcision?</span></h2>

<p>There are those, even among the Hebrews, who are so imbued with the
purely theological idea of the origin, performance, and causes of
circumcision, that they cannot see any moral nor hygienic value in the
operation. Among many Christians the idea still prevails that
circumcision is the relic of some barbarous rite, practiced in some
epoch away in the remote ages of the world, grafted on to the Jewish
religion by some accident or other; but that beyond the clinging of the
Jews to this custom, as being a remnant of their old religion, they
neither see in the rite any other significance, moral results, nor
hygienic precaution; and the fact of a Jew being circumcised is too
often made a subject of merriment among the unthinking portion of the
Christian world. Neither are physicians all of one accord on the subject
as to whether circumcision is a benefit, or, being useless, a dangerous
and an unnecessary operation. The writer is most emphatically in favor
of circumcision, and has the fullest faith in the positive moral and
physical benefits that mankind gains from the operation.</p>

<p>It may well be asked: What does the Jew receive in return for all the
suffering that he inflicts through circumcision on himself and his
little children? What is there to repay him or his for all the risks and
annoyances, besides branding himself and his with an indestructible
mark, which has been more than once the sign by which they have suffered
persecution, spoliation, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
expatriation, and death? Are there any benefits enjoyed by the Jew that
the uncircumcised does not enjoy in equal proportion?</p>

<p>The relative longevity between the Hebrew race and the Christian nations
that dwell together under like climatic and political conditions
indicates a stronger tenacity on the part of the Jewish part of the
nations to life, a greatly less liability to disease, and a stronger
resistance to epidemic, endemic, and accidental diseases. By some
authorities it has been held that the occupations followed by the Jew
are such as do not compel him to risk his life, as he neither follows
any labor requiring any great and continued exertion, nor any that
subjects him to any great exposure; that, as a rule, when in business,
by some intuition he follows some branch that has neither anxiety, care,
nor great chance of loss connected with it; that he does not follow any
occupation that is attended with any risk of accident for either life or
limb. Besides all these, it is also urged that in cities the careful
inspection of their meat, and the peculiar social fabric of the family,
the love and veneration for their aged, as well as their proverbial
charity to their own poor and sick, and their provident habits and
hygienic regulations imposed upon them by the Mosaic law, are all
conditions that conspire to induce longevity.</p>

<p>That the Hebrew is generally found in such conditions as above described
is undisputed; but it is questionable if all these conditions are
necessarily such as are favorable to health and long life, and that,
therefore, the longevity of the Jewish race cannot altogether be
ascribed to the above conditions. Looking at the subject of occupation,
if we consult Lombard, Thackrah, and the later works on the effects of
occupation on life, we must admit that the Jew has no visible <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
advantage in that regard, as he follows hardly any out-of-door
occupation, being often in-doors in a confined and foul atmosphere. To
those who have closely observed the race in this country,&mdash;coming
as they do from the cold-wintered climates of Germany, Austria, or
Poland, bringing with them the habit of living in small, close rooms,
for the sake of economy and comfort,&mdash;it must be admitted that
among the lower classes and the poorer of the race, their shops being
connected, as they usually are, with their living-rooms, the <i>toute
ensemble</i> is anything but conducive to a long life. Their an&aelig;mic
and undeveloped physical condition and weak muscular organization are
sufficient evidence that their surroundings are not calculated to
improve health. In England, statistics sufficiently prove that the
fisherman on the coast, exposed to all kinds of weather, is not as prone
to disease as is his brother Englishman who deals out the groceries in
his snug shop. Exercise has been held an important element in the
factory of the long-lived. From the time of Hippocrates down to Cheyne,
Rush, Hufeland, Tissot, Charcot, Humphry, and all authorities on the
factors of old age, exercise has been looked upon as favoring long life.
Exercise cannot be said to enter in any way as a factor in the longevity
of the Jew; but, on the contrary, his in-door life is known to be very
productive of phthisis in other races. His recreations are, as a rule,
of the home social order. They visit and spend the time allotted to
recreation in social intercourse, which their hospitality always insists
on accompanying with a generous lunch, which, to say the least, is not
an element that is conducive to either health or long life; for no
people excel the Jew in home hospitality, and even among the poorer
classes a stranger is never allowed to depart without some refreshment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
being offered him. Among the class better able to extend hospitality,
social reunions and card parties, with lunches of fruits, cakes, cold
meats and coffee, or wines, are among their regular occurrences. Their
great affection for the family and for their youth and aged suggests
these means of recreation, as then they are enjoyed by all alike; but,
as observed, the hygiene of all this is very doubtful; it produces too
much irregularity.</p>

<p>It is related that after the Roman conquest of Palestine many of the
Jews, becoming more or less accustomed to Roman manners and customs,
often joined in the games which the Romans held in imitation of the old
Olympic games of the Grecians. Not to be ridiculed, many resorted to the
practices described in a previous chapter, to efface all the marks of
their circumcision, that they might enter the games with as much freedom
as the Romans or other uncircumcised nations; so that the present
aversion to out-of-door sports evinced by the Jew is not necessarily a
racial trait; the persecutions and political inequality that until
lately he has been made to suffer have driven him into retirement and
seclusion. Although seeking neither converts nor political power and
influence, he has been hunted down, massacred, and chased about as a
dangerous beast. As the children of the great Rabbi Moses Mendelssohn
asked of their father: &ldquo;Is it a disgrace to be a Jew? Why do
people throw stones at us and call us names?&rdquo; It may well be
asked, why? These actions have forced them into the social and retired
habits for which they are noted; although it cannot be said that it is
from a lack of spirit, as one of the Rothschilds is well known to have
been present at the battle of Waterloo, where from a spot in the
vicinity <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of the British right-centre he observed the events of the battle; and
when, with the failure of Ney&rsquo;s last desperate charge with the
formidable battalions of the Old Guard, he saw the advance of the
Prussians closing in on the French right, he galloped to the sea-shore,
and, crossing the Channel in a frail boat, reached London twenty-four
hours in advance of the news of the battle,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
but long enough for him to clear several millions from off the panicky
state of the money market. Marshal Massena, one of Napoleon&rsquo;s
bravest generals, the defender of Genoa and the hero of Wagram, was of
Jewish origin.</p>

<p>Athletic sports are not of necessity conducive to long life, even if
they are to temporary robust health; but there is no mistaking the fact
that the sedentary and in-door life of the average Jew is a deteriorator
to health and life, and especially among that class of families who are
poor and keep no servant; from heredity and home education having
adopted unhygienic customs, in which they have grown up,&mdash;in these a
total disregard for all ventilation forms a part. Were an uncircumcised
race so to live, scrofula and phthisis would be the inevitable result.
This difference of results I have witnessed more than once as existing
among the two races coming from the same European nationality, where
their disregard to ordinary rules of hygiene, induced by climatic
causes, especially ventilation, were alike in both the Semitic and
European descendants of the one nation, the purely European being more
prone to consumption and scrofula. It is interesting to note the
difference in the moral, mental, and physical conditions induced by
creeds; it would seem as if it should not make any difference. The
generally accepted idea of religion is that it should raise the moral
standard of all <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
those nations who practice religion; but the results are very peculiar,
as we are forced to admit that reformation in religion has not always
been a reformation in morals. Take Great Britain for example; if
illegitimacy is any criterion of the moral state of those professing
creeds, we find the least among the Jew; next among the Catholic; next
comes the Episcopalian; then last the Presbyterian,&mdash;the oldest
creed showing the greatest moral tendency, and that of poor Knox, which
is the youngest, showing the least. This has certainly its physical
effects, that are not without its influence in producing a greater or
lesser length of life. The evolution of religion has here induced a
lower moral tone and a resulting physical degeneracy.</p>

<p>As observed by alienists, religions of different creeds have different
tendencies in inducing insanity, both as to ratio of population and as
to manifestations;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
the Protestant, when unbalanced by religious cause, is generally
controlled with some idea that shows itself in wild and erratic attempts
at scriptural interpretation, caused by want of fixed dogmas and the
unending splittings that are forever taking place in the new faith, and
the persistent, intrusive, and belligerent spirit of proselytism that
controls each new branch as it buds into existence. The Catholic has a
fixed dogma, which the church attends to, and he neither feels called
upon to make his neighbors miserable or himself insane in hunting up new
interpretations. When he does go insane on the subject of religion, the
cause, as a rule, can be traced to some real or imagined moral
delinquency, which has brought all the terrors of the punishment of the
damned forcibly and persistently to his disordered imagination. In the
insane-asylums of Cork, in Ireland, with its overwhelming Catholic
population, the ratio of inmates in regard to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
creeds is as that of one Catholic to ten of the Reformed religion,
showing in the most conclusive manner the influence exerted by religion
in this direction. On the other hand, the Jew has the simplest of
religious creeds; he neither wastes useful time, robs himself of sleep,
nor becomes dyspeptic in hunting for hidden meanings in some ambiguous
scriptural phrase; he is satisfied with his creed, his dogmas are firmly
anchored, and the nature of his religion being a sort of family
congregation, he is not called upon to go out in search of proselytes,
any more than the father of an already large family feels called upon to
go out and hunt up the homeless, that he may convert his home into a
promiscuous orphan-asylum. As before remarked, his creed is of the
simplest, and there exists a complete and explicit understanding between
his God and himself. There are no mystical, hidden meanings in Scripture
for the Jew; nor does he dread any eternal, unheard-of, and inexplicable
torments. His laws are very clear, and the punishments for their
infraction very explicit. To the Jew it is a straight and well-lighted
road, as far as religion is concerned. The writer has always felt that
it took a mind that was incapable of appreciating simple truths, but
that loved to hover on that mystical border-land on the confines of
gloomy insanity that would allow its owner to seriously wander through
and behold any theological beauties in Bunyan. To the Jew there is none
of the gloomy, weird, mystical, mind-racking, ungodly theology that some
of our creeds torture the poor brains of their professors with. As the
wild Indian of the plains runs sticks through his anatomy and capers
wildly about to torture his body, so some of the creeds delight in
torturing their devotees. The Jewish religion is the one best suited to
tranquilize the mind; it is very philosophical <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and rational. Were he to acknowledge Christ, he would not have to
change his course of life to become a most exemplary Christian. The
celebrated letter of Moses Mendelssohn to the Swiss clergyman, Lavater,
in answer to a dedication of the latter to Mendelssohn, is probably the
best exposition of the essence of the Jewish faith that can be found.
Therein he says: &ldquo;We believe that all other nations of the earth
have been commanded by God to adhere to the laws of nature. Those who
regulate their conduct according to this religion of nature and of
reason are called <i>virtuous men of other nations</i>, and are the children
of eternal salvation.&rdquo; Such a religion does not unsettle
man&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>These apparent digressions are made to show what additional factors
exist, besides circumcision, to induce longevity in the Jewish race, and
that the subject may be better understood; for these reasons the above
comparisons have been made. Students of demographic science are well
aware that form of government, religion, climate, diet, habit, and
custom,&mdash;all have an important bearing on the mental and physical as
well as on the moral nature of man. To the true student of his art all
these conditions are but factors in the physical scale, and should so be
considered without fear or favor; to him the whole world is but a unit,
and the people upon its surface are but as one people, alike subject to
the leveling laws of nature, which recognize neither royalty nor
vagrant, nationality nor creed, color, condition, nor station in life or
society.</p>

<p>Professor Bernoulli, of Bale, found the Israelite less prolific than the
Christian;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
subject to less mortality, greater longevity, less still-born, less
illegitimacy, less crime against the person, and less insanity and
suicide, when compared with his Christian brother&mdash;all <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of which he attributes not to a superior physique or organism, but
solely to the observance of the laws of their religion and to the nature
of the same, which exercises a beneficial influence on the mind.</p>

<p>B. W. Richardson, in his &ldquo;Diseases of Modern Life,&rdquo; in
speaking of the relation of race to disease, says: &ldquo;Through the
valuable labors of MM. Legoyt, Hoffmann, Neufville, and Mayer, we have
obtained, however, some curious facts relative to the most widely
disseminated of all races on the earth, the Jewish. These facts show
that, from some cause or causes, this race presents an endurance against
disease that does not belong to other portions of the civilized
communities amongst which its members dwell. The distinctness of the
Jews in the midst of other and mixed races singles them out specially
for observation, and the history they present of vitality, or, in other
words, of the resistance to those influences which tend to shorten the
natural cycle of life, is singularly instructive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The resistance dates from the first to the last periods of life.
Hoffmann finds that in Germany, from 1823 to 1840, the number of
still-born among the Jews was as 1 in 39, while with other races it was
1 in 40. Mayer finds that in Furth children from one to five years of
age die in the proportion of 10 per cent. among the Jewish, and 14 per
cent. among the Christian population. M. Neufville, dealing with the
same subject, from the statistics of Frankfurt, gives even a more
favorable proportion of vitality to the Jewish child population.
Continuing his estimates from the ages named into riper years, the value
of life is still in favor of the Jews, the average duration of the life
of the Jew being forty years and nine months and that of the Christian
being thirty-six years and eleven months. In <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the total of all ages, the half of the Jews born reach the age of
fifty-three years and one month, whilst half of the Christians born only
reach the age of thirty-six years. A quarter of the Jewish population
born is found living beyond seventy-one years, but a quarter of the
Christian population is found living beyond fifty-nine years and ten
months only. The Civil State extracts of Prussia give to the Jews a
mortality of 1.61 per cent.; to the whole kingdom, 2.62 per cent. To the
Jews they give an annual increase of 1.73 per cent.; to the Christian,
1.36 per cent. The effective of the Jews require a period of forty-one
years and a half to double themselves; those of other races, fifty-one
years. In 1849, Prussia returned one death for every forty-one of the
Jews and one for every thirty-two of the remaining population.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Jews escaped the great epidemics more readily than the other
races with whom they lived. Thus, the mortality from cholera amongst
them is so small that the very fact of its occurrence has been disputed.
Lastly, that element of mortality, suicide, which we may look upon
philosophically as a phenomenon of disease, is computed by Glatter, from
a proportion of one million of inhabitants of Prussia, Bavaria,
W&uuml;rtemburg, Austria, Hungary, and <ins class='corr'
title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;Tranyslvania&rsquo;.">Transylvania</ins>, to have been committed by
rather less than one of the Jewish race to four of the members of the
mixed races of the Christian population. Different causes have been
assigned for this higher vitality of the Jewish race, and it were indeed
wise to seek for the causes, since that race which presents the
strongest vitality, the greatest increase of life, and the longest
resistance to death must in course of time become, under the influences
of civilization, dominant. We see this truth, indeed, actually
exemplified <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
in the Jews; for no other known race has ever endured so much or
resisted so much. Persecuted, oppressed by every imaginable form of
tyranny, they have held together and lived, carrying on intact their
customs, their beliefs, their faith, for centuries, until, set free at
last, they flourish as if endowed with new force. They rule more
potently than ever, far more potently than when Solomon in all his glory
reigned in Jerusalem. They rule, and neither fight nor waste.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Richardson attributes the great benefits enjoyed in this regard by the
Jewish race to the soberness of their lives. This position is, however,
not altogether tenable, if by that we mean abstemiousness; they are
extremely temperate, but not abstemious. Tissot, Cornaro, Lessius,
Hufeland, Humphry, Sir Henry Thompson, as well as the older Greek and
Roman authorities, all are agreed that an abstemious life is the one
that is most conducive to long life. There is no race that is more
proverbial for their good cheer and indulgence in the good things of the
table than the Jewish; no race enjoys feasting any more than they, and
from childhood they are accustomed to a generous and nutritious diet, as
well as to their share of the wines with which their tables are
supplied. Their greater thrift and application to business, their habits
of economy and carefulness in business affairs enable them to better
supply their tables. In California there is no class that lives better
or whose tables are supplied so well either as to quality or quantity as
those of the Jews, and yet no class is more exempt than they from the
class of diseases that originate in too good living. As before remarked,
in relation to the poor of that faith, who are unable to keep a servant,
and who live in a combination of shop and home in the most unhygienic
condition, disregarding ventilation <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and every other sanitary needs, but who, nevertheless, escape the evil
results that would and do attend such social conditions among those of
other races, so in this instance of good living: the better class of
Jews do not suffer in anything near a like proportion to the better
class Christians from diseases incident to too full habits and an
inactive life. Richardson observes that he drinks less and that he eats
better food than his Christian brother. In regard to the drinking habit,
overindulgence is not a Jewish failing; they do not drink to excess, but
total abstinence is not in their vocabulary. It is inconsistent with
their idea of wine as being a gift of God, and something that is
symbolical of good faith and thanksgiving. Nor is total abstinence
consistent with their idea of generous hospitality. On the eighth day
after birth the Jew tastes wine, and from the time he is able to sit at
table he becomes familiar with its use. To him wine is not symbolical of
either moral depravity, mental or physical deterioration, or of death.
Their females are all accustomed to its use from childhood, but it does
not cause them to become either immoral or unchaste; so that in neither
sex does wine produce that moral and mental wreckage which abbreviates
the length of human existence among those of other creeds. Radical
fanaticism, that drives a tack with a maul and a twenty-penny spike with
a tack-hammer, cannot be expected to study this or any other question in
any rational manner; but to the sociologist, the question as to what
produces this remarkable soberness, in the midst of the habitual and
continued use of wine in the race from the time of its earliest history,
is something worthy of calm and careful consideration. How much
circumcision may have to do with this will be discussed in the medical
part of the volume.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
In London, according to Dr. Stallard, the mortality among Jewish
children from one to five years is only ten per cent., while among the
children of the Christians it is fourteen per cent., the rate being
analogous to that observed by Mayer among those of these ages in Furth.
Among the London adults the average duration of life among the Jews is
forty-seven years, while among the Christians it is only thirty-seven.</p>

<p>Dr. Hough<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
has gathered some interesting historical and statistical matter bearing
on the subject of Jewish resistance to disease and the benefit possessed
by the race in relation to the immunity enjoyed by them in prevailing
epidemics. The plague of 1346 did not affect them; according to
Fracastor they escaped the typhus of 1505; Rau remarks their immunity to
the typhus of 1824; Ramazzini noticed their exemption to the fatal
intermittents of Rome, in 1691; and Degner says that they escaped the
epidemic dysentery at Nimegue, in 1736. Richardson truly observes that
&ldquo;from epidemics the Jews have often escaped, as if they possessed
a charmed life.&rdquo; This racial difference and benefit, when compared
to other races, has more than once cost them dear. In the dark and
ignorant ages, when men reasoned nothing from a physical basis, but
attributed all and every phenomena to some supernatural agency, either
heavenly or diabolical, it was but natural for such minds to associate
this exemption with some purchased compact made with the devil, who was
often also held accountable for the existence of the epidemics. The
rational and law-of-nature observing Jew supposed to be in league with
his satanic majesty could neither be seen nor heard in his own defense;
consequently, massacres, pillaging, and such other barbarities that an
insane popular fury could suggest, were the humane manifestations <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
with which a Christian people visited their Jewish brothers, whose only
sin consisted in worshiping the God of their fathers, and in strictly
observing His laws and commandments.</p>

<p>In France, Dr. Neufville found that, of one hundred children in the
first five years of life, among the Jewish population, 12.9 die; while
from the same number of the same aged class of Christians 24.1 die.
One-half of all the Christians die at thirty-six years, and one-half of
all the Jews at fifty-three years and one month.</p>

<p>Dr. John S. Billings has gathered statistics relating to 10,618 Jewish
families, consisting of 60,630 persons,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
living in the United States in December, 1889, mostly descendants of
Jews from the northern or middle nations of Europe. For our purpose only
the deductions as to death-rate and tendency to longevity will be given.
In this valuable paper Dr. Billings says: &ldquo;When we come to examine
the reports of deaths for five years furnished by these Jewish families,
we find that they give an average annual death-rate of only 7.1 per
1000, which would be about one-half of the annual death-rate among other
persons of the same average social class and condition living in this
country.&rdquo; To this he adds that, provided the deaths at different
ages among the Jews have been correctly reported, this race will, on
comparison with those of other races, show a greater tendency to
longevity, as the Jewish expectation of life is at each age markedly
greater than that of the class of people who insure their lives, the
average excess being a little over twenty per cent.</p>

<p>In speaking of the death-rate among children, Dr. Billings makes the
following comparisons: &ldquo;The low death-rate among the Jews is
especially marked among the children, and this corresponds to European
experience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Thus in Prussia, in 1887, the death-rate of the Jews under fifteen
years of age was 5.63 for 1000, while among the remainder of the people
it was 10.46 per 1000.&rdquo; This result he accounts for partly to the
fact that among the Jews illegitimacy is comparatively rare and to the
high rate of mortality among the illegitimate born, which raises the
average of the other classes.</p>

<p>In regard to the immunity of the race from consumption or tubercular
disease, the statistics of the above Jewish families gives to the Jews
less than one-third of the number of deaths from these diseases than
what occurs among the others as to the male population, and less than
one-fourth as to the female population. These statistics coincide with
the observations of the writer on this part of the subject, and are even
more than corroborated by the French War-Office Reports from Algeria,
where the deaths from consumption among the Christians amount to 1 for
each 9.3 deaths, and among the Jews to 1 in 36.9, while among the
Mohammedans it is only 1 in 40.7 deaths. In Algeria the relative
mortality from all causes is only about three-fifths of that of the
Christian, and the Turk, although seeming to enjoy a greater exemption
from phthisical or tubercular diseases than the Jew, falls below the Jew
in exemption from deaths due to general causes, as his mortality is
one-eighth greater than that of the Jew. Dr. Billings gives us some
interesting food for thought in the course of his article and some more
particularly bearing on the subject of immunity from consumption. He
asks: &ldquo;Are these differences due to race characteristics, properly
so-called, to original and inherited differences in bodily organization,
or are they, rather, to be attributed to the customs, habits, and modes
of life of the two classes of people?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Some years ago, Henry I. Bowditch, of Boston, put on foot an extended
system of inquiry in regard to ascertaining the causes or antecedents of
consumption in the State of Massachusetts. In answer to some of the
questions of the circular, Rabbi Dr. Guinzburg, of Boston, answered as
follows, under date of October 29, 1872:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. The number of Jews living in Boston is about 5000.</p>

<p>2d. There certainly have not died of consumption, during the last five
years, more than eight or ten Jews in the various congregations.</p>

<p>To this Dr. Bowditch adds, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Dr. Guinzburg&rsquo;s data be correct, they show a very great
immunity from consumption on the part of the Jews, compared with the
citizens generally, as will be seen by the following comparison between
these numbers and those procured from the Registration Reports,
published by the State. In the report published in 1869, page 64, we
find that for the five years preceding 1869 the annual average of deaths
by consumption was 338 for every 100,000 living. These data from Dr.
Guinzburg and the State Report give the following table:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td></td><td align='center'>Proportion of Deaths to<br />100,000 of Living.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>All religions,</td><td align='center'>338</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Jews,</td><td align='center'>&nbsp;40</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>&ldquo;These statements from Dr. Guinzburg are confirmed by the
following letter from Dr. A. Haskins, of this city. Dr. Haskins is
connected with one of the Jewish benevolent associations for the benefit
of the sick. I sent to him similar questions and make the following
extracts from his reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am generally employed in about sixty families<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
(Jewish). I have had these families under my care for two and a half
years. During this time I have seen but one case of consumption. I have
averaged among these sixty families about two visits daily. In my other
Jewish practice, which is not inconsiderable, I have in this time (two
and a half years) seen two cases of consumption.... I am sorry I have no
statistics whereby I could compare the two peoples, viz., Jews and
Christians. I can, therefore, give you only my impressions. I should say
that I find consumption less frequent among the Jews than among
Christians. This would be my own impression without any data to fortify
it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Waterman also sustains the same idea. The following extract
will give some idea of his opportunities for observation and the sources
of his deductions:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class='sc'>Boston</span>, November 2, 1872. Dear Sir,&mdash; ... First, I have
attended four charitable associations; number about forty, fifty, sixty,
and one hundred families. At present I only attend one, containing one
hundred families, and on which I average a fraction over one visit a
day. I have, besides, many private families among the Jews. I have
attended but few cases of consumption, and I think the disease is not so
prevalent as among Christians.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same report of Dr. Bowditch quotes from Stallard&rsquo;s
&ldquo;London Pauperism Amongst Jews and Christians,&rdquo; as saying
that there is no hereditary syphilis, and scarcely any scrofula to
augment the mortality in the Jewish families.</p>

<p>In relation to the liability of the Hebrew race to phthisis, Richardson
has the following at page 22 of his &ldquo;Diseases of Modern
Life&rdquo;: &ldquo;The special inroads on vitality made on other races
by disease are not easily determined, because of the difficulties
arising from temporary <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
admixture of race. I tried once to elicit some facts from a large
experience of a particular disease, phthisis pulmonalis, and, as the
results of this attempt may be useful, I put them briefly on record.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At a public institution at which large numbers of persons
afflicted with chest diseases applied for medical assistance, and at
which I was for many years one of the physicians, I made notes during a
short portion of the time of the connection that existed between race
and the particular disease I have instanced&mdash;phthisis pulmonalis, or
pulmonary consumption. The number of persons observed under the disease
was three hundred, and no person was put on the record who was not
suffering from a malady pure and simple; I mean without complication
with any other malady. They who were thus studied were of four classes:
(<i>a</i>) those who were by race distinctly Saxon; (<i>b</i>) those who were of
mixed race, or whose race could not be determined; (<i>c</i>) those who were
distinctly Celtic; (<i>d</i>) those who were distinctly Jewish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The results were, that of the three hundred patients, one hundred
and thirty-three, 44.33 per cent., were Saxon; one hundred and eighteen,
39.33 per cent., were of mixed or undetermined race; thirty-one, 10.33
per cent., were Celtic; and eighteen, 6 per cent., were Jewish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although Dr. Richardson admits it would be unfair to accept the above
figures as a basis for general application, he argues that they are, on
the average, sufficiently suggestive, as among the Saxons it was noticed
that there were more cases in whom the disease was hereditary, while
among the others it was generally acquired.</p>

<p>In going over the subject of this question in regard to phthisis, we
must admit that, although the Jew in his own home, synagogue, or in his
social reunions, is not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
exposed to tubercular emanations, and that he has less chance of
contracting the disease from tuberculous meats, he is, after all, a
theatre-goer; a pretty constant inhabitant of the sleeping-car and
hotel, as a commercial traveler and general merchant; and that, on the
whole, he eats the same food, breathes the air and dust of the same
streets, and drinks the same milk and water as the Christian, and, as
observed by Dr. Billings, cooking destroys the bacillus in meats. So
that the comparative exposure in this country&mdash;where the practice
is not as prevalent as in Germany of eating raw minced-meat
sandwiches&mdash;existing between the Jew and the Christian to
tubercular infection from meat are about equal. The records of the
Jewish Hospital of New York gives, out of 28,750 persons admitted, only
44.17 per 1000 of its admissions as being due to consumption; while
those of the Roosevelt Hospital, out of 25,583 admissions, gives a per
1000 of 67.93.</p>

<p>From what is known of the relation of syphilis to consumption, not only
as affecting the primary individual, but the subsequent generations of
the same, and the known greater exemption of the Jew to syphilitic
infection, owing to the protecting influence of circumcision, it is safe
to assert that therein is to be found one of the main reasons of the
exemption of that race to consumption. If we but look at the
geographical distribution of phthisis and the history of its progress,
we shall find that it has had syphilis as its <i>avant courrier</i> on more
than one <ins class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original
showed &lsquo;occasian&rsquo;.">occasion</ins>. Lancereaux, in his
&ldquo;Distribution of Pulmonary Phthisis,&rdquo; points to the fact
that where consumption has made its greatest ravages, and where it has
nearly depopulated one of the great divisions of the globe,&mdash;namely, the
groups of islands in the Pacific Ocean,&mdash;the disease had no existence at
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
beginning of the present century. Syphilis, scrofula, and a quick,
galloping consumption have, since the last ninety years, taken off the
greater part of the population. The same course of transition from the
best of physical conditions to racial deterioration and extinction from
the same relative condition of causes&mdash;syphilis, scrofula, and
phthisis&mdash;has been observed among the open-air dwellers of the New
Mexican Plains, in the mountains of Arizona, and on the arid wastes of
the Colorado Desert, where the appearance of consumption cannot be
attributed to housing or incipient civilization, as it is attributed to
housing among the Chippeways, Sioux, or Mandans in the regions that
formerly formed the Northwest Territory. The question is very plainly
answered as to how consumption was introduced or whence it sprung that
has so ravaged the Oceanic Islands. The sailors who first visited those
islands were not, as a rule, a batch of consumptive tourists on a voyage
in search of health or recreation; but we can well understand that the
proverbially improvident mariner has not always had his health looked
after by an Anson or a Cook, and that many a festive tar who induced the
unsophisticated Indian maid to join him in worship at the shrine of
Venus Porcina carried in the innermost recesses of the folds of his
pendulous and sea-beaten prepuce the remnants of former Bacchanalian
festivities performed in the questionable temples of Venus and Bacchus
in Portsmouth or London. Consumption, as such, was neither imported nor
propagated by Europeans into those islands, its original entry being in
the shape of syphilis. Had it been the ancient mariners of old
Ph&oelig;nicia in the days of its circumcision, or the circumcised
marines of the ancient Atlantean fleets from the sunken continent of
Plato, instead of the uncircumcised <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
sailors of modern England, that first and since visited those islands,
it is safe to say that consumption would not now exist there. From this,
it may be well to inquire what would be the relation between the Jewish
race and consumption; were circumcision among them to be done away with,
would it not be greatly on the increase?</p>

<p>The weight of testimony is evidently convincing that the Jew has a
greater longevity and stronger resistance to disease, as well as a less
liability to physical ills, than other races; that all these exemptions
or benefits are not altogether due to social customs is evident; how
much circumcision may have to do in inducing these favorable conditions
can be better appreciated by a consideration of how circumcision affects
those of other races, and more particularly how its performance works
changes in the individual in his general health and condition, and in
doing away with many physical ailments that the individual was
previously subjected to. So that the Jew cannot be said to be a loser by
his observance of this rite, and he and his race have been well repaid
for all the sufferings and persecutions that its observance has
subjected them to. As observed by John Bell, &ldquo;The preservation of
health and the attainment of long life are objects of desire to every
man, no matter in what age or country his lot is cast, nor by what
arbitrary tenure he holds his life. They are the wish of the master and
the slave, of the illiterate and the learned, of the timid Hindoo and
the warlike Arab, of the natives of New Zealand not less than of the
inhabitants of New England,&mdash;an indispensable condition for the greatest
and longest enjoyment of the senses and propensities; for the widest
range and exercise of intellect and gratification of the sentiments,
whether these be lofty or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
ignoble, health, in any special degree, has ever been a fit subject of
contemplation and instruction by the philosopher and legislator. Their
advice and edicts on the means of preserving it have frequently been
enforced as a part of religious duty, and, at all times, civilization,
even in its elementary forms, has been marked by laws on this head. With
the numerous and minute hygienic enactments of the great Jewish lawgiver
for the guidance of the people of Israel we are all familiar. Prompted,
we may suppose, in part by the example of Moses, and also by
considerations growing out of the nature of the climate in which he
lived, Mohammed incorporated with the mingled reveries, ethics, and
blasphemies, which composed his Koran, dietetic rules and observances of
regimen that are to this day implicitly obeyed by his zealous
followers.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>If circumcision is not a factor in the difference that exists between
the Jewish race and other races, if it goes for nothing as an exemptor
of disease and the promoter of longevity, then there must exist some
other factor or cause that induces these conditions. What this factor
is, the legislator, the sociologist, and the physician should make it
their business to find out.</p>

<p>The peculiar differences that exist between different animals in regard
to their susceptibility to the action of drugs is even more remarkable
than the differences that exist in their susceptibility to certain forms
of disease. We can understand and appreciate what Koch tells us in
regard to the different susceptibilities exhibited by the house-mice and
the field-mice to the anthrax bacillus, or why a nursing child should
offer different results, when exposed to the diphtheria bacillus or the
contagious poison of any of the exanthemata, from those witnessed in the
meat or promiscuously dieted child. We can also appreciate that
different individuals have different susceptibilities to disease, as
well as we understand that the same degree is not always in an unvarying
point of resistance or susceptibility in the same individual. The
investigation and study of these conditions teach us, however, that
there is a cause, or that there are causes that induce and modify this
susceptibility. But there are conditions that are as yet beyond our
comprehension. Take, for instance, two animals, both vertebrates,
mammals, and dwelling together, eating the same food, and even having a
mutual understanding or sympathy of mind and affections, having a like
circulation, a like brain and nervous system, it would naturally be
supposed that these two would exhibit a like susceptibility to the
actions of narcotic poisons; but when we are told that one <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
dog has taken 21 grains of atropia with impunity we are staggered.
Atropia may not affect rabbits (as it does not), but the rabbit does not
approach man in the same close relationship as the dog. Richardson
administered to a healthy young cat 7 drachms of Battley&rsquo;s
solution of opium, then 10 grains of morphia, and a little later 20
grains more of morphia without rendering the cat unconscious. The same
experimenter gave to a pigeon 21, 30, and 40, then 50 grains of powdered
opium on succeeding days with no bad effect. S. Weir Mitchell gave to
three pigeons, respectively, 272 drops of black drop, 21 grains of
powdered opium, and 3 grains of morphia without any effect.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
On the other hand, horses show a like susceptibility to man to the
action of drugs. In the island of Ceylon, a sloth can take 10 grains of
strychnia with safety,&mdash;chickens presenting a like immunity to the
poisonous effects of this alkaloid. While the dog offers such a contrast
to the action of drugs as compared to man, he is as subject to goitre,
and they have been seen in a true state of cretinism.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>An Apache, or Colorado Indian, will prefer a dessert of decomposed
gophers to one composed of the best canned peaches or Bartlett pears; he
will devour the mass without any resulting evil, while a German&mdash;after
many generations of training on all forms of sausages in every degree of
age and ripeness, and on every form of cheese, from the refreshing
cottage cheese from curdled milk and the delicious cream cheese, down
through to all and every grade as far as Limburgher, or maggoty, common
cheese&mdash;has not, in every case overcome the tendency of the civilized
intestine and constitution to the action of sausage poison, something
that has no effect on the ordinary Indian, or on the uncivilized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
dweller north of the arctic circle. Even the house-dog, that faithful
companion of man, in many cases living on exactly the same fare as his
master, is insensible to the action of this poison. An Indian will gorge
and gormandize, after a prolonged fast, on such quantities and qualities
of food that, if the ordinary white man were to indulge in a like feast,
he would be in imminent danger of literal rupture or explosion, or
liable to end in sudden apoplectic seizures, or, in case of a too
healthy and active digestion, liable, owing to a lack of a
correspondingly active condition of the excretory organs, to go off in
ur&aelig;mic coma. This sporadic and fitful feasting has no perceptible
effect on the Indian, who either simply works it off in exercise, or
sleeps it off in a long and prolonged period of sleep, during which his
lungs work with the deep and steady pull and persistence that a tug-boat
exhibits when towing in a large ship against the tide and a head
wind,&mdash;working in and out more air in one respiration than the
ordinary white man will in a dozen. All these different conditions are
more or less plain to us and as easy of explanation,&mdash;just as plain
as to how and why some birds eat gravel to improve their digestion. In
the cases of different susceptibility to the action of strychnia or of
narcotics, the explanation must of necessity, for the present, be more
or less speculative. But how are we to account, even in the way of
speculation, for the peculiar immunity, lack of predisposition and
hereditary tendencies to disease exhibited by the Hebrew, who, since the
history of the world, has been a civilized and rational
being,&mdash;even for decades of centuries before the civilization of
Europe? Living under the same forms of government, climate, and shelter,
practically using the same varieties of food and drink, he exhibits
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
an entirely different vitality and resistance to disease, decay, and
death,&mdash;being, in fact, a puzzle to the demographic student. The
only really marked difference that exists between this race and the
others lies in the fact that the Hebrew is circumcised, other
differences not being sufficiently constant to be accounted as factors.
Circumcision is, in the opinion of the writer, the real cause of the
differences in longevity and faculty for the enjoyment of life that the
Hebrew enjoys in contrast to his Christian brother. Christian and
uncircumcised races may individually, or in classes, develop some
peculiar immunity or exemption, as, for instance, the tolerance to
arsenic exhibited by some German mountaineers, or the peculiar safety
enjoyed by the butcher class from attacks of continued fever;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
but these exemptions are purchased at the expense of the future, the
effects of arsenic, long continued, finally having its morbid effects,
and the very plethora which is the bulwark of resistance in the butcher,
this plethora being in the end a treacherous foe, diseases result from
it which make a sudden ending to this class when it is least expected.</p>

<p>For an all around long-liver the Hebrew holds a pre-eminence, and, as
the factor in this pre-eminence, circumcision has no counter-claimant.
Circumcision is like a substantial and well-secured life-annuity; every
year of life you draw the benefit, and it has not any drawbacks or
after-claps. Parents cannot make a better paying investment for their
little boys, as it insures them better health, greater capacity for
labor, longer life, less nervousness, sickness, loss of time, and less
doctor-bills, as well as it increases their chances for an euthanasian
death.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>The Prepuce, Syphilis, and Phthisis</span>.</h2>

<p>It is not alone the tight-constricted, glans-deforming,
onanism-producing, cancer-generating prepuce that is the particular
variety of prepuce that is at the bottom of the ills and ailments, local
or constitutional, that may affect man through its presence. The loose,
pendulous prepuce, or even the prepuce in the evolutionary stage of
disappearance, that only loosely covers one-half of the glans, is as
dangerous as his long and constricted counterpart. If we look over the
world&rsquo;s history, since in the latter years of the fifteenth
century syphilis came down like a plague, walking with democratic tread
through all walks and stations in life, laying out alike royalty or the
vagrant, the curled-haired and slashed-doubleted knight, or the tonsured
monk, we must conclude that syphilis has caused more families to become
extinct than any ordinary plague, black death, or cholera epidemic.
Without wishing to enter into a history of syphilis, it is not outside
of the province of this book to allude to its frequency and spread.</p>

<p>Syphilis is not restricted to classes by any means; it is not those of
the lower class alone who are its victims. Dr. Fr. J. Behrend, in his
work, &ldquo;Die Prostitution in Berlin,&rdquo; observes that abolition
of the brothels in that city in 1845, &rsquo;46, &rsquo;47 and
&rsquo;48, trebled the number of cases of syphilis treated at the Der
Charit&eacute;; in the year 1848 the cases of syphilis treated at that hospital
numbered over 1800. It was also remarked during this period of
legally-enforced virtue, that, as inconsistently <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
as it might appear, the disease invaded the best of families. From Dr.
Neumann, in his brochure entitled &ldquo;Die Berliner
Syphilisfrage,&rdquo; published in 1852, we learn that, in the Trades
and Mechanics&rsquo; Benevolent Union of Berlin, in 1849, 13.51 per
cent. of the sick were so from syphilis.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth volume of the <i>British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical
Review</i>, we find, in a review of the control of prostitution, an
estimate in regard to the syphilization of a nation. The estimates are
made on the most conservative figures, as, in the desire of the reviewer
not to overestimate, he starts by figuring out the actual number of
prostitutes in England, Wales, and Scotland to be only 50,000, when they
were estimated, by those who had carefully studied the subject, as being
more than double that number; the conservative estimate is, however,
suitable for our purpose; so that we cannot be accused of overestimating
the results. The portion of the review to which we wish to call
attention is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though the result of the evidence contained in the first report
of the commissioners on the constabulary force of England and Wales was
that at that time about 2 per cent. of the prostitutes of London were
suffering under some form of venereal disease, yet we will descend even
lower, and presume that of one hundred healthy prostitutes, taken
promiscuously from England and Scotland, if each submits to one
indiscriminate sexual act in twenty-four hours, not more than one would
become infected with syphilis, an estimate which is without doubt far
too low; yet, if admitted to be correct, the necessary consequence will
be, <i>that of the fifty thousand prostitutes five hundred are diseased
within the aforesaid twenty-four hours</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
&ldquo;If we next admit that a fifth of these five hundred diseased
women are admitted to hospital on the day on which the disease appears,
it follows <i>that there are every day on the streets four hundred
diseased women</i>. Let it be supposed that the power of these four hundred
to infect be limited to twelve days, and that of every six persons who,
at the rate of one each night, have connection with these women, five
become infected, it will follow <i>that there will be four thousand men
infected every night, and consequently one million four hundred and
sixty thousand in the year</i>. Further, as there are every night four
hundred women diseased by these men, one hundred and eighty-two thousand
five hundred <i>public prostitutes will be syphilized during the year;
hence, one million six hundred and fifty-two thousand five hundred cases
of syphilis in both sexes occur every twelve months</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If, then, the entire population had intercourse with prostitutes
in an equal ratio, <i>the gross population of Great Britain, of all ages
and sexes, would, during eighteen years, have been affected with primary
syphilis</i>. Be it remembered, we do not assert that more than a million
and a half of <i>persons</i> are attacked every year, but that that number of
<i>cases</i> occurs annually in England, Wales, and Scotland, though the same
individual may be attacked more than once. Although it is evident that
all the estimates used for these calculations are (we know no other word
that expresses it) ridiculously low, yet we find that more than a
million and a half of cases of syphilis occur every year,&mdash;an amount
which is probably not half the actual number. How enormous, then, must
be the number of children born with secondary disease! How immense the
mortality among them! How vast an amount of public <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and private money expended on the cure of this disease!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same reviewer (P. S. Holland), in another article on the
&ldquo;Control of Prostitution,&rdquo; observes that among the British
troops syphilis is one of the most frequent of diseases, about one
hundred and eighty cases occurring annually among every one thousand
soldiers.</p>

<p>The effect of syphilis in depopulating the islands of the Pacific has
been pointed out in a former chapter; the nature and origin of the
disease that takes them off is unmistakable. Scrofula and rapid phthisis
are taking off the inhabitants at a rate that, in those islands most
affected, the native population will soon become extinct. According to
Lancereaux, in the Marquesas group the women do not live beyond the age
of thirty to thirty-five years, three or four months being the duration
of the disease. Ellis, in his &ldquo;Polynesian Researches,&rdquo;
published in 1836, remarks that at that date the disease, as above
described, had but recently appeared. In the nineteenth volume of the
&ldquo;Archives de M&eacute;decine Navale,&rdquo; Rey mentions that at the
Easter Island pulmonary phthisis is the dominant affection with the
adults, and that scrofula is very prevalent with the children.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The effect of syphilization in inducing a scrofulous taint and the
appearance of a rapidly-marching consumption among savage races has been
well observed among the Indians in the southwestern parts of the United
States, where the appearance of these fatal diseases can easily be
traced to that as a cause. There is something peculiar about the
Anglo-Saxon race that is fatal to the Indian; wherever they come in
contact, the savage race begins physically and morally to crumble; the
habits of the Anglo-Saxon in the matter of intemperance and his lust
soon end the poor Indian; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
while, on the other hand, the Latin races mix with them without any
physical detriment to the Indian. In what was formerly the Northwest
Territory the French and Indian intermarried, and syphilis did not begin
to tell on the Indian until the Americans settled the country. From
these observations it is very evident that in the Polynesian Archipelago
syphilis must have been the precursor of the phthisis and scrofula, as
we know it to have been that which induced those diseases among the
Indians of the Mississippi or Missouri Valleys, or of the Colorado and
Mojave Deserts, or in the mountains and valleys of Arizona.</p>

<p>On the other hand, circumcised races, whose women have not carried a
syphilitic taint into the race, are as a class free from any syphilitic
taint. Neither their teeth, physiognomy, skin, nor general condition
denote any syphilitic inheritance. This is true of the Jewish
descendants of Abraham, who have more strictly adhered to the
non-intercourse or marriage with other races, and whose women have
abstained from vice; the Arabian descendants of Ishmael have, in a great
measure, also retained their marked family individuality, except it be a
few tribes, who, by contact with the soldiery of European nations, have
had their women corrupted and syphilis introduced into the tribe through
this channel.</p>

<p>Richardson, in his &ldquo;Preventive Medicine,&rdquo; observing on the
effects of syphilis in inducing deterioration of the organs of
circulation and their degenerative changes, says that, in his opinion,
syphilis is the progenitor of various diseases, and that those who give
this opinion the greatest range are, unfortunately, nearest the truth.
The breathing organs, he remarks, are distinctly susceptible to injury
from this hereditary cause.</p>

<p>In 1854, at the Metropolitan Free Hospital, situated <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in the Jews&rsquo; quarter in London, Hutchinson observed that the
proportion of Jews to Christians among the out-patients was as one to
three; at the same time the proportion of cases of syphilis in the
former to the latter was one to fifteen. Now, this result was not due to
any extra morality on the part of the Jews, as fully one-half of the
gonorrh&oelig;a cases occurred among those of that faith. J. Royes Bell
also observes the less syphilization among circumcised races.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The absence of the prepuce and the non-absorbing character of the skin
of the glans penis, made so by constant exposure, with the necessary and
unavoidably less tendency that these conditions give to favor syphilitic
inoculation, are not evidently without their resulting good effects. Now
and then syphilitic primary sores are found on the glans, or even in the
urethra or on the outside skin of the penis, or outer parts of the
prepuce; but the majority are, as a rule, situated either back of the
corona or on the reflected inner fold of the prepuce immediately
adjoining the corona, or they may be in the loose folds in the
neighborhood of the frenum, the retention of the virus seemingly being
assisted by the topographical condition and relation of the parts, and
its absorption facilitated by the thinness of the mucous membrane, as
well as by the active circulation and moisture and heat of the parts. It
must be evident that but for these favoring conditions the inoculation
or infection would and could not be either as sure or as frequent. Any
protecting mechanical aid that interferes with these favoring conditions
grants an immunity to the individual, even when he is freely exposed;
this protection has often been obtained by applying to the glans and
penis a substantial coat of some tenacious oil like castor-oil, which
was afterward gently washed off, first <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
in a shower of tepid water and afterward in a tepid bath of warm water
and borax.</p>

<p>Horner, formerly of the navy, in his interesting little work on
&ldquo;Naval Practice,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> relates that it was customary, in the
older navy of the United States, to allow public women to come on board
at some of the ports and to go down to the men between decks, the
Department of the Navy being probably actuated by the same humane
principle that used to induce some of the West Indian cannibals to lend
their wives to their prisoners of war who were intended, in the shape of
roast or <i>fricandeau</i>, to grace the festive board, as it was deemed
inhuman by these philanthropists to deprive a man of his necessary
sexual intercourse, even if they were soon to roast him and pick his
bones. They may, however, have been selfish in the matter, as by some
authorities it is represented that this was done to improve the flavor
of the prisoner, who was said to offer a more savory dish through this
considerate treatment, the strong flavor that the semen gives to flesh
being well eradicated by free fornication. Whether it was through these
motives of humanitarianism, or the feeling that an American tar was the
equal of the British tar, whose praises and equality Sir Joseph Porter,
K.C.B., writes a song about in &ldquo;Pinafore,&rdquo; who had as much
right to contract a left-handed marriage as any Prince of Wales or any
other prince or crowned head of Europe, the women were, nevertheless,
allowed to go down between decks in preference to giving the men
indiscriminate liberty on shore, the government further providing for
their welfare by causing the assistant surgeon to examine the women at
the gangway or hatchway, to see that they were not diseased. Horner
relates the ludicrous appearance presented by a near-sighted assistant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
at one of the hatchways while making this professional examination,
surrounded by the sailors and marines, who were greatly-interested
spectators. Had the government provided a pot of castor-oil wherein the
tar could dip his penile organ, as bridge piles are dipped into a
creasoting mixture, these humiliations to our professional brother could
have been avoided.</p>

<p>In the conclusion to be reached, circumcision is not put forward as the
only exempting element or preventive measure that deserves all the
credit for the immunity that the Jews enjoy from syphilis, or to the
absence of hereditary diseases that are secondary or due to the presence
of that disease in the parents, as considerable credit is to be given to
the well-known chastity of their females. This chastity is, in a great
measure, due to the inseparable conditions of their religion,&mdash;moral and
social fabrics which are welded into one. Their charity assumes the most
practical form, so that it is not possible for one of their females to
have to resort to a life of prostitution to save herself or her children
from starvation, as, unfortunately, is too often the case in Christian
communities, where religion is put on and off with Sunday clothes. The
temperance and sobriety, as well as the economy and industry of the
father, are not without a good moral as well as a hereditary effect on
the daughters, who are neither rendered brutal nor demoralized through
the example and instigation of drunken fathers. They have, therefore, a
better average homelife, to which they cling and which protects them.
The aid and benevolent associations of the Jews are among the most
efficacious of charitable institutions, and no class gives more freely
or generously for this purpose. The Home for Aged Hebrews in New York is
an example of the character with which they dispense charity. We
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
need not, therefore, be <ins class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s
Note: The original showed &lsquo;suprised&rsquo;.">surprised</ins> to find, in
statistics of illegitimacy by religious denominations taken in Prussia,
that the Jewish women are three times as chaste as the Catholics and
more than four times as chaste as the Evangelists.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
The Jew has, therefore, two avenues of infection from syphilis cut
off,&mdash;the lesser liability due to his circumcision and the chastity
of the women.</p>

<p>Richardson mentions the immunity of the Jewish race from tubercular
disease, and notices the well-known relation existing between a
syphilitic taint and a phthisical tendency. The comparative statistics
offered by the Mohammedans, Jews, and Christians in regard to deaths
from consumption have already been mentioned in a former chapter, they
being as four Christians to one Jew, while the Mohammedan, from his
greater abstemiousness and temperance to assist him, shows a still lower
percentage than the Jew. There can be but little doubt that to this
particular and well-marked less syphilization the Hebrew race owes much
of its exemption from many other diseases and its greater resistance to
ordinary ailments and epidemic diseases.</p>

<p>The relative less frequency of syphilis among all circumcised people is
noticed by Dr. Bernheim, in his brochure &ldquo;De la
Circoncision,&rdquo; he being the surgeon of the Israelitish Consistory
of Paris. His utterances on this subject are worthy of attention, he
having not only paid particular attention to this, but having had
unusual opportunities for the basis of his opinions. Dr. Bernheim looks
upon coition as a frequent source of tubercular infection, and the
sensitive and absorbing covering of the uncircumcised glans as a ready
medium of transmission of the virus from one system to the other. He
calls attention to the frequent granular condition <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of the uterine os, in confirmed cases of tuberculosis, as something
that is too much overlooked. This view of the case, from Dr.
Bernheim&rsquo;s stand-point, is worthy of greater consideration than it
has generally received at the hands of the profession.</p>

<p>The great number of examples that have recently come to light in
connection with the direct inoculability of tubercular consumption, both
in the later works on phthisis and in the medical press, are not without
interest or without a lesson. The case recorded within the past year of
a healthy chambermaid, who was immediately inoculated with tubercular
matter with rapidly-following constitutional effects through a scratch
on the hand, received from the sharp edge of a broken china cuspidor
that a consumptive was using, is one of these cases that are to the
point; so it is evident that the uncircumcised need not always wait for
the degeneration of syphilis into syphilitic phthisis or syphilitic
scrofula to become a consumptive, but it is within the greatest range of
possibility and probability that he may become at once a consumptive
through an excoriation or abrasion received during coition with a
tubercular woman. So many tubercular prostitutes ply their trade, or, to
be more definite, so many prostitutes become tubercular, and in its
different stages follow their occupation as the only means of keeping
out of the poor-house, that man runs as much if not more risk, in
consorting with the class, of contracting tuberculosis than that of
contracting syphilis.</p>

<p>There is something about syphilis that is not generally noticed; we are
all well acquainted with the dire results that usually follow syphilitic
infection, its course through every stage of suffering and misery, its
transmission and effects in tubercular meningitis or in syphilitic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
affections of the mesentery through heredity in children, and of the
many horrible cases of destruction of tissue, in skin, mucous membrane,
cartilage, or bone, with their attending mutilations and disfigurations;
but there is no record of the great number of cases, and very few
physicians of any extended practice but who can recall some such cases,
where, after undoubted syphilitic infection, with the usual course of
primary sores and secondary eruption, the patient has suddenly blossomed
out into a state of robust health that his system was an entire stranger
to before the infection. The writer has, in the course of a long
practice, seen a number of such results follow both the infection
attended with a miliary eruption and that followed by the large
small-pox-appearing eruption, both kinds being preceded by the primary
sore; and these results have been observed in cases of both what are
called the soft and multiple and the hard or Hunterial initial sore.
Some of these cases rapidly gained in flesh, with an evident increase in
the redness of their blood, increasing in vigor and strength with a very
perceptibly less tendency to attacks from accidental or previously
subject-to diseases.</p>

<p>The same result has been observed to follow an attack of small-pox with
some individuals, and the writer well remembers a similar result
following a very extraordinary event. The subject was a man well known
among his old comrades of the First Minnesota Infantry as
&ldquo;Duke,&rdquo; and to many of the older practitioners of Wabashaw
County, of that State, as &ldquo;Old Duke.&rdquo; In early life he was
sickly and weakly, never having fully recovered from a malarial fever
contracted in the Mexican war. Coming to Minnesota, he adopted the life
of a raftsman, with all the irregularities that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
accompanied such a life. On one occasion, after a protracted spree,
feeling the need of stimulation and not having the wherewith to procure
it, he secured a jar in which a snake and several other reptiles were
preserved in spirits, and drank the fluid contents. He was, some days
afterward, taken violently ill with a high fever and racking pains,
ending in an eruption of boils that covered him from head to foot; he
made a slow and tedious recovery; but when recovered he seemed to have
become imbued with a constitution resembling <i>lignum-vit&aelig;</i>, for a
more stubborn-twisted constitution never existed than that of &ldquo;Old
Duke.&rdquo; The power of resistance that this man developed was
something wonderful. Dr. C. P. Adams, of Hastings, Minnesota, and the
St. Paul physicians who were connected with the regiment well remember,
though, wiry, precise, and soldierly &ldquo;Duke,&rdquo; who, even in
the old Army of the Potomac, immersed up to his ears like the rest of
the army in the mud and dirt of the encampment of Falmouth, above
Fredericksburg, came out on general inspection as prim as if he had just
stepped out of a bandbox, for which he received a medal for soldierly
conduct and bearing.</p>

<p>These apparent digressions are not made either to be tedious or to weary
the reader, nor without an object. They are made to show that, whereas
syphilis is looked upon as such a deadly disease, and it may be said to
be the sole cause of fear to the assiduous worshiper at the shrine of
Venus Porcina, there is another still more fatal danger awaiting him,
ambushed in the folds of the vaginal mucous membrane, or coming along
silently out of the cervical canal,&mdash;like the legions of Cyrus stealing
along the dry bed of the Euphrates into ancient Babylon, to fall
unawares on the feasting Nebuchadnezzar on that fatal night. So, in like
manner, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
virus of tuberculosis, either extruding from a granular os or from its
neighborhood, gradually moves down on the unsuspecting, uncircumcised,
and easily inoculable-surfaced glans penis, to infect the system with a
tubercular poison that has no such exceptions as those above noted, as
at times are the followers of syphilis. It is not alone the individual
himself that may be the sufferer from this poison, but his progeny for
several generations may have to suffer for the infection thus received,
just as much as they would were that infection to have been syphilitic.
As before remarked, this has heretofore not sufficiently occupied the
consideration of the profession, and, as it cannot certainly be denied
that such a source of tubercular infection is both possible and
probable, the subject is entitled to more serious and deliberate
consideration than that which has heretofore been paid to it.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis certainly has these two channels of entrance: either
through direct infection or through an evolutionary process resulting
from syphilis. The appearance and vital statistics offered by the French
War Office in regard to the Algierine provinces, the report of the
United States Census, the opinion of Dr. Billings deduced from the
census reports, the opinions of Hutchinson, Richardson, Bernheim, and
many other observers, as well as the personal but unrecorded
observations of many practitioners, all tend to bear testimony to the
remarkable difference that exists between circumcised and uncircumcised
races in regard to the ravages of consumption. Is circumcision a factor
in this difference, or is it not? If it is, then circumcision should
receive more attention than it has; if it is not, then we should not be
idle in hunting up the cause of difference, for an ounce of prevention
is certainly worth in this regard a whole pound of Koch&rsquo;s lymph as
a curative agent.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>Some Reasons for Being Circumcised.</span></h2>

<p>The surgical and medical history of circumcision is intimately connected
with the remotest ages, this being, in fact, the earliest surgical
procedure of which we have any record. From the same records we obtain
hints as to two conditions for which circumcision probably was
suggested, either as a preventive or as a remedy.</p>

<p>Jahn, in speaking of the people by whom the early Hebrews were
surrounded, mentions their idolatrous practices, and that their peculiar
forms of Pagan worship were accompanied by indulgence in fornication,
lascivious songs, and unnatural lust. Others of their neighbors
worshiped the &ldquo;<i>hairy he-goat</i>,&rdquo; with which they also
practiced all manner of abominations. Sodomy, or pederasty, seemed a
sort of religious ceremony with some of these heathen nations; from a
religion it necessarily became a social practice; this, in connection
with the phallic practices and worship, necessitated frequent exposure
of the male member. The evil results, to say nothing of the disgusting
and demoralizing tendency of these practices of the Pagan, were
evidently well known to the Jews. The contrast between the physique and
health of the pastoral habits, out-of-door life and simple diet of the
Jews, and the necessary opposite condition of health and physique due to
luxury and to these practices among their neighbors, could not have
escaped their attention. How much onanism had to do with the
establishment of circumcision may well be conjectured. Again, the other
hint is in reference to procreation, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
as some stress is laid to the connection between the conception of
Sarah and the circumcision of Abraham. Here we have suggestions of a
preventive to onanism, and a cure to male impotence when due to
preputial interference.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, these two important results, due to
circumcision, seem to have been lost sight of for some thousands of
years, as even the able works of the physicians of the latter part of
the last century have nothing to say connecting onanism and
circumcision. Neither the works of Tissot on male onanism nor the
pioneer work of Bienville on nymphomania speak of the presence of the
prepuce in the male, or of the nymphar or clitorian prepuce in the
female, as being causative of, or their removal curative of, either
masturbation, satyriasis, or nymphomania; moral, hygienic, and internal
medication being by both these authors considered to be all that our
science could offer or do to alleviate or cure this unfortunate class.
It is only of late years that circumcision, in its true relations to
onanism, has received full consideration. In regard to its being a cure
of impotence, its recognition has been of longer duration.</p>

<p>It is related by Leonard, in his &ldquo;Memoires,&rdquo;&mdash;who, in his
capacity of hair-dresser in ordinary to her Majesty, the unfortunate
Marie-Antoinette, had ample opportunity for picking up all the domestic
small talk of the royal family and their affairs,&mdash;that Louis XVI, in
addition to all his troubles and the indignities which he suffered,
besides finally being beheaded, was afflicted with a congenital phimosis
which prevented the flow of semen from properly discharging itself. It
appears that his Majesty was no little annoyed at not being able to
procure an heir to his throne. His royal sister-in-law, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the Countess d&rsquo;Artois, had given birth to a prince, the Duke of
Angouleme, who was the heir presumptive to the throne in case of the
non-issue from Louis; another sister-in-law had been brought to bed with
a royal princess, and here was the king himself without any prospective
possibility of any heir. Like all kings, he was more or less
unreasonable; so he blamed his first surgeon in ordinary for all these
short-comings,&mdash;as if it were the duty of these court surgeons,
among their many other tribulations, to furnish heirs to thrones. The
surgeon finally informed his Majesty that if he wished to become a
father it would be necessary for him to submit to the slight operation
that was the subject of the church festival of the first day of January,
namely, the Feast of the Circumcision. His most Christian Majesty
entered a protest to this acknowledgment that there was anything in
Judaism worth imitating. The surgeon insisted that the operation
celebrated on the first of January would put him in a way to have the
much-desired heir. The king finally waived all objections from any
religious scruples, but could not be brought to look at the prospective
operation with any sentiments of agreeable expectation.</p>

<p>The king finally became good-natured, and a touch of that plebeian
jollity which at times made him quite agreeable spread over his features
as he imagined the ludicrousness of the spectacle that would be
presented by a king of France in the hands of these handlers of the
scalpel, treating him like an African savage. He took some days to
consider the matter. On the next day he informed M. Louis, his first
surgeon in ordinary, that he had decided on submitting to the operation,
and the day and hour were fixed. The royal circumcision, however, never
took place, as it is most likely that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
in the privacy of his chamber his Majesty worked, like many a plebeian
or man of low degree had done before him and has done since, to bring a
refractory prepuce to terms. The king was somewhat of a mechanic, as his
skill as a locksmith has passed into history; so that it is not unlikely
that, with what little information he had on the subject, he managed to
sufficiently dilate, by scarification and stretching, the preputial
opening, as from the year 1778 the queen had three children.</p>

<p>Cases of attempted self-circumcision are not rarities, as people have
some inexplicable idea that a self-inflicted cut is not as painful as
one that is done by others. The writer well remembers being called to
assist one of these domestic surgeons who had undertaken to circumcise
himself with his wife&rsquo;s great scissors. The man had a very long
but thin and narrow prepuce that had always been an annoyance to him.
The writer had circumcised two of his children for the same
malformation, and the father, seeing the benefit to these two,
determined to share in the general benefit; but at the same time he
arranged to do it all by himself, and give the family and the surgeon a
sample of his courage and a simultaneous surprise party. Securing the
scissors, he wended his way unperceived into the recesses of his
wood-shed. The mental and physical anguish the poor man underwent, and
what soliloquies he must have addressed to the rafters of the wood-shed
while making up his mind and screwing up his physical courage for the
last fell act with the scissors, can hardly be described, as, in all
probability, they were of the most rambling and inconsistent order. At
any rate, he must have reached a climax in time and grasped the fated
prepuce with a revengeful glee, and, with all his powers concentrated in
his good right hand, he must have closed the remorseless <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
blades of the scissors on the unlucky prepuce. When the surgeon arrived
at the scene of carnage, he was directed to the wood-shed, on the
outskirts of which hovered the family, frantic with fear and
apprehension; within, in the darkest corner, with wildly dilated eyes,
and performing a fantastic <i>pas seul</i>, was a man with a huge pair of
scissors dangling between his legs, warning all hands as they valued his
life not to approach or lay a hand on him. He had shut the scissors down
so that it clinched the thin prepuce, and there his courage and
determination had forsaken him; he lost his presence of mind, and was
not even able to take off the scissors; he had simply given one wild,
blood-curdling yell&mdash;like the last winding notes from
Roland&rsquo;s horn at Roncevalles&mdash;that had brought his family to
the wood-shed-door, and they had then sent for a surgeon. New terrors
here awaited the unlucky victim for self-circumcision. He dreaded lest
the surgeon should accidentally have it enter his mind to finish the
operation with the scissors, and in that case he would be helpless, as
the surgeon would, undoubtedly, have a sure and tender hold of it. After
executing a number of <i>pas &agrave; deux</i> on the Magilton step, while
the surgeon endeavored to reassure him and gain his confidence,
promising to remove the scissors without inflicting any further harm, he
was finally allowed to approach, and, while the patient assumed a
Taglioni attitude on one foot, the other leg being extended at right
angles with the body and his hands clawing the air, the scissors was
removed. The patient, through the aid of lead lotions and a week&rsquo;s
rest, made a good recovery with a whole prepuce, chagrined at his
failure, but happy to have escaped immediate pain.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>There is not much doubt but that the operation could <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
have been suggested by its, at times, spontaneous performance, a case
of which, by Cullerier, and some other additional cases have been
mentioned in a former chapter. Cases occur at times, also, wherein the
person having a previously normal and uninterfering prepuce has, through
either herpetic inflammations or through impure connection, spurious
gonorrh&oelig;a, or the use of some venereal-disease preventing-wash
after connection, produced some irritation resulting in the abnormal
thickening of the inner fold, or an interstitial deposit at the <ins
class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;function&rsquo;.">junction</ins> of the skin and mucous membrane, with
consequent constriction, this deposit finally forming a hard, inelastic
ring, which prevented a free exposure of the glans and interfered in
sexual connection. In such cases,&mdash;like in stricture of the
meatus,&mdash;any mechanical interference short of cutting with a knife
only aggravates the existing difficulty, and it is not uncommon to have
such cases apply for assistance after they have in vain tried to dilate
the constricting preputial orifice. In the early writings of the Greeks,
it is mentioned that among the Egyptians circumcision exempted them from
a certain form of disease that affected the penis. Philon mentions
particularly the immunity that the operation conferred against a species
of affection which Michel Levy asserts to have been a gangrenous
disease. So that, outside of any religious significance, there is no
doubt that, in individual cases, circumcision has more than once been
suggested, although it cannot be said that such individual cases would
ever, or could, lead to its becoming a national or racial, much less a
sectarian, rite.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>The Prepuce as an Outlaw, and its Effects on the Glans.</span></h2>

<p>Ricord has well termed this appendage to civilized man &ldquo;a useless
bit of flesh.&rdquo; Times were, however, when&mdash;man living in a wild
state, and when in imitation of some of our near relatives with tails
and hairy bodies; when he still found locomotion on all-fours handier
than on his two feet; when in pursuit of either the juicy grasshopper or
other small game, or of the female of his own species to gratify his
lust, or in the frantic rush to escape the clutches, fangs, or claws of
a pursuing enemy, he was obliged to fly and leap over thorny briars and
bramble-bushes or hornets&rsquo; nests, or plunge through swamps alive
with blood-sucking insects and leeches&mdash;Ricord&rsquo;s definition would
certainly have been inapplicable. In those days, but for the protecting
double fold of the preputial envelope that protected it from the thorns
and cutting grasses, the coarse bark of trees, or the stings and bites
of insects, the glans penis of primitive man would have often looked
like the head of the proverbially duel-disfigured German university
student, or the Bacchus-worshiping nose of a jolly British Boniface. So
that in those days, unless primitive man was intended to have an organ
that resembled a battle-scarred Roman legionary, a prepuce was an
absolute necessity.</p>

<p>With improvement in man&rsquo;s condition and his gradual evolution into
a higher sphere, the assumption of the erect posture, and the great
stride in civilization that <ins class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s
Note: The original showed &lsquo;orginated&rsquo;.">originated</ins> the
invention of the manufacture of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
perineal band, which not only protected the glans in its thorny passage
through life, but also acted like a protecting &aelig;gis to the scrotum
and its contents, the prepuce became a superfluity; not only a
superfluity, but, now that its natural office had been replaced by the
perineal cloth, it actually began to be a nuisance, as its former free
contact with the air had retained it in a state of vigorous and
disease-resisting health which was now fast departing. As Montesquieu
observes, in the causes that led to the decline and fall of the Roman
Empire, those seasons of trials, tribulations, and struggle for
existence are those of health and progress and healthy life, and the
periods of luxury and idleness are those of degeneracy and decay. So
with the prepuce, the luxury and idleness, voluptuousness and consequent
feasting incident to its being supplanted in its original functions by
the perineal cloth, which left it thenceforth unemployed, led it in the
pathway of disease and death. This first innovation in civilization was
to the prepuce the beginning of its decay and fall. Like Belshazzar in
his great banquet-hall in ancient Babylon, the prepuce might have read
the hand-writing on the wall, &ldquo;<i>Mene, Mene, Tekel,
Upharsin</i>,&rdquo; and foreseen the gory end that awaited it. Like to
other human affairs, however, even in his fallen estate a kind word can
be said for the prepuce. Puzey, of Liverpool, has found it of extreme
value, and even unequaled by any other part of the body, for furnishing
skin-grafts,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
these grafts showing a vitality that is simply phenomenal, considering
the laxity of its tissues and its seemingly adipose character. There is
no doubt, however, that for skin-transplanting there is nothing superior
to the plants offered by the prepuce of a boy, and where any large
surface is to be covered this should undoubtedly be chosen, as offering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the greatest and quickest success and the least chances of failure.
This is really the only disadvantage that can be charged against
circumcision, as in a strictly circumcised community they would be
debarred from this great advantage. An uncircumcised individual could be
procured, however, to supply the deficiency. It is related that in the
latter part of 1890, a Knight Templar, in Cincinnati, required a great
supply of grafts or skin-plants to cover a largely-denuded surface, and
that the whole of his Commandery chivalrously and generously supplied
the needed skin-plants in a body. A few healthy prepuces would have been
more efficacious. In advising the use of the prepuce for these purposes
it must not be overlooked that in case of a white man it would not do to
use skin of any other color besides his own. We have no data to base any
assertion as to the relative action of skin-grafts taken from Mongolians
or Indians, but we have very reliable data in relation to the
proliferating action of those of the negro,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
which induces a growth of epidermis of its own kind; so that preputial
grafts from the negro, combining the extra vitality and proliferation of
the preputial tissue with the strong animal vitality of the negro, if
applied to a white man, might not produce the most desirable cosmetic
effects, especially if on one side of the countenance.</p>

<p>But, taken as a whole, when considered in its relation to onanism,
nocturnal enuresis, preputial calculus, syphilis, cancer, and a lot of
nervous and other ailments, or induced abnormal physical conditions, we
can really conclude that the days of the prepuce are past and gone, that
it has outlived its usefulness, and that those whom a religious or civil
ordinance or custom happily makes them rid of it are people to be
greatly envied. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Sancho Panza remarked, &ldquo;God bless the man who invented
sleep,&rdquo; so we may well join in blessing the inventor of
circumcision, as an event that has saved some parts of the human family
from much ill and suffering.</p>

<p>Phimosis is an ancient attendant on our inheritance of the prepuce, we
being, in fact, born with it; this is the rule. There are, however,
exceptions to this rule, which, singularly enough, are found to be
hereditary. The writer has met with a number of such instances, and they
have always been found to have been family traits. Within the past year,
after attending a confinement, his attention was called to the child by
the nurse, who thought that the child was deformed; the nurse,
singularly enough, never having seen a natural-looking glans penis in
all her life, was astonished at the size and appearance of the member.
On examination, the organ showed a complete absence of prepuce. On
inquiry, the father and another son, born more than twenty years
previously,&mdash;this comprising every male member of the family,&mdash;were
found to have been thus born, with the glans fully exposed. The family
is now residing in San Diego, and is naturally one of more than superior
physical health and intelligence. I saw another family similarly
affected in the north of France, and of individual cases, without
knowing the history of the rest of the family, I have seen a large
number. As the prepuce can be observed in every stage of disappearance
among mixed races, it would seem that in time it would disappear
altogether. Its effectual absence in so many cases evidently belongs to
some evolutionary process, and shows beyond question that nature does
not insist on its presence either as a necessity or as an ornament.</p>

<p>The word or term &ldquo;phimosis&rdquo; is derived from two Greek roots,
signifying &ldquo;string&rdquo; and &ldquo;to tighten,&rdquo; or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
&ldquo;to tie with a string.&rdquo; Galen, from its signification,
accepted the word, and from him it has been transmitted through the
different epochs of medicine down to our own times. In virtue of its
etymological significance, it was formerly applied to any stenosis or
closure of duct or aperture, but at present the term is used simply to
denote that constriction that affects the prepuce, and which prevents
the glans from being passed through the preputial orifice. Phimosis is
said to be congenital or natural and acquired. The first of these is the
common lot of all, as a rule, and with some it remains so throughout
life. As babyhood advances in boyhood and boyhood into youth, the
prepuce gradually becomes lax and distensible, and in proportion to the
existence of these conditions it also loses in its length. Where,
however, the distal end persists in its constricted condition it is
drawn forward as the penis increases in bulk.</p>

<p>In many cases its tightness prevents the escape of the sebaceous matter
that collects in the sulcus back of the corona, and the resulting
irritation on the surface of the glans and the inner mucous fold of the
prepuce ends in an inflammatory thickening of the latter, its inner
surface becoming thick, undilatable, hard, and unyielding, all the
natural elasticity that should be present having departed, with more or
less inflammatory thickening and adhesions between the two layers of
skin that form the prepuce. In this unyielding tube the glans is
imprisoned and compressed, often suffering the tortures that the
&ldquo;maiden&rdquo; of the dungeons of the Inquisition inflicted on the
unhappy heretics. It becomes elongated, cyanosed, and hyper&aelig;sthetic; the
meatus of the urethra is congested and hypertrophied, the corona is
undeveloped and often absent, the glans having, on the whole, the
long-nosed, conical appearance of the head <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of a field-mouse. There are hardly five per cent. of the uncircumcised
but who suffer in some degree from this constricting result of the
prepuce, to a greater or less extent.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the unconstricted glans penis assumes the shape and
appearance that is seen in the circumcised. The head is shorter, the
face flat and abrupt, and the meatus, instead of being at the end of a
conical point, is situated on the smooth, rounded front of the glans,
and does not differ in color from the covering of the glans itself. From
the superior commissure of the meatus to the sulcus in the rear of the
corona its topographical outline may be said to describe two opposite
segments of a circle, as seen in the cuts representing the glans in its
natural shape. The corona is prominent and well developed.</p>

<p>The opponents of circumcision base much of their opposition to the fact
that circumcision interferes with the natural condition of the parts.
The question may well be asked, which of these two shaped glans is the
natural product as nature intended it should be? It is a well-known fact
that the most forlorn and mouse-headed, long-nosed glans penis will,
within a week or two after its liberation from its fetters of preputial
bands, assume its true shape. We may naturally inquire if nature made
the glans of a certain shape, which seems to be the proper shape for
copulative purposes, only to have the condition most effectually
abolished by a constricting, unnatural band? How much the shape of this
glans, from meatus to corona, may have to do with retaining the urethra
to a healthy and normal calibre and condition has not been inquired
into, but, as far as the writer has observed, a normal glans seems to
have less abnormalities of the urethra, and in treating such <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
cases he has always found that when the urethra of one of these
normal-glans subjects was affected it was far easier to manage; on the
other hand, secondary and even a tertiary recurrence to an operation is
often the fate of a long, narrow, conical-pointed penis.</p>

<p>Phimosis is known to have been a cause of male impotence by its direct
interference with the outward flow of the seminal fluid; but, although
we have cases where impregnation has taken place by the aid of a warm
spoon and a warm syringe, as in the case related in a former chapter, it
must be admitted that the corona is not without some functional office
in the act of procreation. Its shape indicates a valve action like that
of the valve in a syringe-piston, and if we examine the two extremes of
these conditions of glans&mdash;one devoid of corona, as many are, and the
other with the corona in its most pronounced form, when in a state of
erection&mdash;the difference, either in the appearance of the two organs or
in the different philosophical action and results that must necessarily
follow the use of these two differently shaped glans, will at once be
apparent. Unfortunately&mdash;or, as many may consider it, most
fortunate&mdash;the female organs are not always so shaped as to be in
themselves wholly favorable to impregnation. The wearing of corsets, the
habitual constipation of females, the relaxed and unnatural condition of
the uterine ligaments and vagina in civilized women, all favor uterine
displacement, with any or all forms of uterine ailments. To this we may
add the effect of repeated miscarriages, application of astringent
washes, irregular menstruation, etc., all of which conditions often
result in an elongation of the neck, constriction of the cervical canal,
with the external os placed on the depended point of the sharply pointed
cervix, which is liable to point in any direction. Just <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
imagine one of these conditioned females and one of the mouse-headed,
corona-deficient, long-pointed glans males in the act of copulation! The
conical penis finds its way in the reflected fold of the vagina, while
the point of the uterus may be two or three inches in some other
direction, making impregnation wholly impossible; besides, in the
normal-shaped penis, the corona acting as a valve, behind which the
circular muscular fibres of the vagina close themselves, tends to retain
the seminal fluid in front, while the very shape of the organ assists in
straightening out the vaginal canal and to bring the uterus in proper
position. In the long, thin, narrow and pointed glans, devoid of corona,
there is no mechanical means to retain the seminal discharge. Some years
ago some one introduced the idea of postural copulation, to be tried in
cases of sterility, and it has been found that impregnation would take
place in some cases where it had formerly appeared impossible, this
position having the effect of righting malpositions during the act,
which were the cause of the sterility; but it stands to reason that,
where the shape of the organ is such that it further favors
malpositions, as well as where it offers no obstacle to the vagina
immediately expressing or dropping out all the seminal fluid,
impregnation is more difficult, and that, where the uterine deformity is
coincident with this condition of penis to assist, it becomes well nigh
impossible. Foder&egrave; mentions a penis about the size of a
porcupine-quill on an adult male, and Hammond mentions one of the size
of a lead-pencil in diameter and two inches in length. From total
absence of the penis, either through disease or accident, to the
diminutive organs mentioned by Foder&egrave; and Hammond, and on up to
the full-sized and normal-shaped organ, we have every degree of sizes
and shapes, and with these <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
go every conceivable degree of ability or faculty for impregnation.</p>

<p>Aside from the foregoing considerations, there are others equally
important. Although Greece was involved for years in war and ancient
Troy was destroyed and all its inhabitants slaughtered because of the
seduction of one woman; and Semiramis, through her beauty, got all her
successive husbands in chancery; and poor, susceptible Samson, from
firing Philistine vineyards and killing lions bare-handed, and the
Philistines by the thousands with the jaw-bone of an ass, was reduced
through Delilah to bitter repentance and turning Philistine mill-stones;
and we know that the familiar infatuation of Antony for Cleopatra ruined
Antony; and we are familiar with the well-known maxim of the French
police-minister, that to catch a criminal it was but necessary to first
locate <i>the woman</i> and the man would soon be found,&mdash;society has
determined to ignore the influence of the animal passions as factors in
our every-day life, or factors in the estrangements, coldness, and the
bickerings that end in divorces. Not to shock the reader with detailed
accounts as to what an important factor the shape of the penis may be in
the domestic economy, I will refer the reader to Brantome&rsquo;s works.</p>

<p>Although the councils of the older church were not above giving these
conditions their calm and deliberate consideration, which resulted in
the foundation of the present physical considerations in relation to
divorce laws, such studies or considerations are at present only touched
upon gingerly and with apologies for doing so, as if the &ldquo;study of
man&rdquo; was of any less importance to-day from what it was in the
days of Moses, the elder church, or when Pope formulated his oft-quoted
but little-followed maxim, that &ldquo;the proper study of mankind <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
is man.&rdquo; The present miscalled &ldquo;delicacy of
sentiment&rdquo; is about as misplaced a condition of disastrous and
misleading morality as was the out-of-place and untimely bravery of poor
old Braddock when refusing Washington&rsquo;s advice at the Monongahela.
The success and beauty of the Mosaic law is its squarely facing the
conditions of actual life, and its absence from nonsense or nauseating
sentimentality. Were our present churches to observe more of this plain
talk, for which the good old Anglo-Saxon is as fully expressive and
convincing as the old Hebrew, and deal less in rhetorical flourishes and
figurative mean-nothings to tickle the ears of our modern Pharisees,
mankind as well as womankind would be infinitely so much the better off,
mentally, morally, and physically, and there would be less of the
conflict between science and religion. Luther&rsquo;s dream of restoring
religion to its primitive purity has come to but as poor realization at
the hands of his so-called followers, which leads one to think that if
the martyrs of the Reformation could come back and see the fruits of
their martyrdom&mdash;suffered that pure religion might live&mdash;they
would conclude that, for all the resulting good accomplished, they might
as well have kept a whole skin and a whole set of bones.</p>

<p>In cases of pronounced phimosis the aperture in the prepuce may not be
in a line with the meatus, and the resulting discharge of urine or the
ejaculations of seminal fluid may from this cause be unable to find an
egress. The fluid escaping from the urethra will, in case the opening is
at the side or upper part of the prepuce, cause it to balloon out until
a sufficient quantity is thrown out so as to distend, the opening as
well as the prepuce, before it can find its way out; in such cases
impotency is liable to be as complete as in those cases <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of stricture wherein the seminal fluid is forced backward into the
bladder. Having given this general view of the effects of phimosis as it
may affect man in the shape of his organ, which may have a serious
result in his domestic relations or in becoming a father, we will
proceed to the consideration of diseases and conditions that phimosis
encourages and to which it renders man more liable. In the consideration
of these cases it must not be forgotten that the sexual relations are
much more to man or woman than is generally acknowledged. The days for
the establishment of the Utopian republic of Plato are not yet with us.
That Platonic love does exist is true, as it has in the past and will in
the future. Scipio, refusing to accept the beautiful betrothed bride of
an enemy as a present, or Joseph leaving his coat-tail in the hands of
the amorous bride of the eunuch Potiphar, with the suicide of Lucretia,
in the past, are events which virtue and modern continence probably
duplicate every day; but these are exceptions to the rule. Physicians
daily see evidences of the most devoted Platonic affection in either
sex, but they also see enough of the opposite side of the question to
convince them that in the majority of cases the sexual relations are the
bond of union, as well as the mainspring of love. As observed by
Montesquieu, the bride of a first-class Turkish eunuch has but a sorry
time, and a woman of the same calibre of mind as that possessed by the
ordinary Circassian or Armenian bride cannot be in a much happier
condition with a husband partly eunuchised by a constricted prepuce.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>Is the Prepuce a Natural Physiological Appendage?</span></h2>

<p>By many surgeons the idea of circumcision, unless connected with an
immediate demand for interference,&mdash;such as a phimosis unmanageable by
any other means, an induced phimosis from gonorrh&oelig;a or other
irritation, syphilis in its initiatory sore, cancer or some such
cause,&mdash;is looked upon as an unwarrantable operation, a procedure not
only barbarous, painful, and dangerous, but one that directly interferes
with the intentions of nature. The prepuce is by many looked upon as a
physiological necessity to health and the enjoyment of life, which, if
removed, is liable to induce masturbation, excessive venereal desire,
and a train of other evils. The question then resolves itself, What is
the real physiological status of this appendage, if it has any, and, if
it is a physiological appendage, when does it merge into a pathological
appendage? As by some it is held that the prepuce enjoys the same right
to live and exist as the nose, ear, or a limb, which are only subject to
amputation in case of a serious disease, they should be reminded that
they are not taking into consideration that the nose and ear are
calculated to warn us of danger, and that our legs are very useful; as
even the great orator Demosthenes, by the timely and rapid use of his
legs, was enabled to escape from a battle, where his oratory was of no
avail against the illiterate javelins of the unscholarly Macedonians. If
the prepuce only was endowed with an olfactory sense,&mdash;as, for instance,
if a nervous filament from the first pair of nerves had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
been sent down alongside of the pneumogastric and then, by following
the track of the mammary and epigastric arteries, had at last reached
the prepuce, where the olfactory sense could have been turned on at
will, like an incandescent lamp,&mdash;it might have been a very useful
organ, as in that sense it could have scented danger from afar, if not
from near, and enabled man to avoid any of the many dangers into which
he unconsciously drops. But, seeing that the prepuce, to say nothing of
being neither nose, eye, nor ear to warn one away from danger, or a leg
to run away on after once in it, having not even the precautionary
sensitiveness of a cat&rsquo;s moustachios, it cannot, in any way that
we can see, be compared to any other useful part of the body.</p>

<p>All attempts to find reasons for its existence that are of real benefit
to man have so far proved unsatisfactory, and, unlike the reasons for
its removal, are, as a rule, founded on speculation. To further reason
out the why and wherefore of its existence or of its summary surgical
execution, we must consider its shifting positions as to the effects it
produces, as well as to its conditions at different ages, sitting on its
case like an impartial jury in the case of some unconvicted but
diabolically-inclined criminal.</p>

<p>As before remarked, we are, as a rule, born with this appendage, just as
much as we are with the appendix vermiformis, which rises up, like
Banquo&rsquo;s ghost, whenever we eat tomatoes or any small-seeded
fruit. This prepuce is then long, and the penis is found at the end of
an undilatable canal, which is formed by the constricted prepuce; at
this early stage of our existence it is often additionally bound down to
the glans by a greater or less number of adhesions. We are then in what
many term a state of physiological phimosis, that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
being a perfectly natural condition, and one consistent with health; at
least, we imagine it is normal.</p>

<p>Phimosis in childhood is generally considered a physiological state,
only to be taken as a pathological condition under certain
circumstances. Preputial adhesions may, according to many observers,
also be classed as physiological at an early period of life, as it is by
them considered as congenital, and common enough to warrant its being
classed as normal. As to the first, or phimosis, it undoubtedly is a
physiological condition during infancy; but why, we do not know; and it
is also a fact that from birth to puberty it remains so in fully over
one-half of the cases. Out of 98 children, from one week to sixteen
years of age, examined by Dr. Packard, the prepuce was entirely
unretractable in 54, partly so in 3, and wholly so in 36; while in 1 it
only half-covered the glans and in 4 the glans was wholly uncovered, 1
of these 4 being an infant only five weeks old.</p>

<p>Dr. Packard also gives the result of 172 examinations by himself, of
from twelve to seventy-three years of age, and 106 examinations by Dr.
Maury, a total of 278, in whom 100 had a long prepuce, 97 a
partly-covered glans, and 81 (of whom 2 had been circumcised) in whom
the glans was exposed.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
As to adhesions, there is an unaccountable diversity of opinion as to
their constancy as a natural condition, being frequent enough to class
them as physiological occurrences. Dr. A. B. Arnold, of Baltimore,
states that his experience in reference to preputial adhesions leads him
to conclude that the frequency of its occurrence has been much
overstated. In the number of children that he has circumcised, which
exceeds 1000, he has met with it in less than four per cent. of the
cases. He also mentions that in the adult the adhesions show greater
firmness.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
On the other hand, Dr. Bernheim, of the Paris Israelitish Consistory,
observes that, of over 3000 newborn whom he has examined, with but few
exceptions he found the presence of preputial adhesions. He remarks,
however, that in the majority these are detached or broken by the first
attempt at erection.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Bokai, out of 100 children, found 8 who were over seven years of age,
who were perfectly free; while of the remaining 92 under that age 6 more
showed no adhesions and 86 had various degrees of adhesions.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Holgate, of the out-door department of Bellevue, considered that all
phimosic cases have adhesions; while Dr. Moses, of New York, out of some
fifty circumcisions performed at the eighth day, found only adhesions
three times.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>These observations are, however, in perfect accord. If we connect the
statement of Dr. Arnold, in regard to the increasing character of the
firmness in the adhesions of the adult, with the statement of Dr.
Bernheim, that the first erection is often sufficient to break up the
existing adhesions in the infant, we must conclude that they are nothing
more at first than a slight agglutination, which the slight manipulation
required to properly locate the position of the glans, and to space out
the prepuce preparatory to the operation of circumcision, must, in the
majority of cases, be sufficient to liberate the prepuce from the glans;
this is evident also from the statement of Dr. Moses, who only found six
per cent. of the cases operated upon by him as being so affected.</p>

<p>The writer has been present at a large number of Hebrew circumcisions
performed on the eighth day, and from that up to the sixth month (as in
many communities they wait until a number of children are collected,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
so to speak, before sending for the mohel, who may reside at quite a
distance), and in all of those witnessed he has never seen any
complications from adhesions; but cases of adhesion have been often
encountered from the second to the eighth year, and it has always been
the case, as a rule, that the older the child the greater the firmness
of the adhesion. In these cases the practice generally advised of using
a probe is not practicable, as the person is more apt to wound the sound
prepuce than to tear the adhesions; the practice most effectual is to
hold the glans firmly but gently with the thumb and forefinger of the
right hand, and then to draw the prepuce as firmly back with its fold
held in the forefinger and thumb of the other. It is a more expeditious
mode, and the least painful; by this method extensive adhesions can
readily be broken up; vaselin and a piece of fine lint should then be
interposed for a couple of days to prevent a re-adherence.</p>

<p>Another co-existing condition with phimosis, very often found, is a
shortening of the frenum. Dr. Jansen, out of 3700 soldiers of the
Belgian army, found 12.3 per cent. with this pathological condition and
2.5 per cent. with a narrow prepuce.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Take the three conditions above enumerated,&mdash;phimosis, preputial
adhesions, and short frenum,&mdash;all are but a departure from a normal, in
a greater or less degree; and whether the resulting discomfort consists
in mere mechanical impediment to urination, erection, or as a factor in
nocturnal enuresis, dysuria, impotence, either through reflex action or
interference with emission, malposition of the urethral orifice during
copulation owing to any of these conditions, or in any of the nervous
derangements that may accompany this condition, or in the more serious
results, ending in positive deformity <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of body or limb, or in the warping of moral sentiments, or, even
further, in inducing insanity, it cannot well be seen how the conditions
that will certainly produce these results, in a more or less degree, can
ever, in any logical sense, be considered a physiological condition.</p>

<p>There are certain conditions to life, up to the time of birth, which,
unless they then cease at once to exist, immediately become from a
physiological into very serious pathological conditions. These are well
understood, and have their reasons for existing during our pre-natal
existence; but the prepuce has no known function during uterine life or
subsequently; and there being no valid reason for its existence, there
are certainly no logical grounds for its being considered a
physiological condition, especially when the serious results attending
the most accentuated form of the above three conditions are considered,
and as its necessity, in cases of its entire absence, has not yet been
demonstrated.</p>

<p>It can well be said that about two-thirds of mankind are affected in a
greater or less degree with these pathological conditions, causing them
more or less annoyance. Of these, a certain percentage suffer a life of
continued misery, as a direct or indirect result of these conditions.</p>

<p>As to the actual necessity of a prepuce existing, or as to what
annoyances or diseases persons are subjected to who are born without it,
there is a most singular and expressive silence in medical literature.
It stands to reason that, if it is a necessity, some one person should
have found it out long ago, and there should then be some evidence to
present in relation thereto. There are cases reported in some of the
older surgeries wherein an attempt has been made, in the absence of a
prepuce, to restore or manufacture one by means of a plastic <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
operation. Vidal describes such an operation,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
but there is no reason given as to why the operation was undertaken;
there is no record of any diseased condition which it was intended
either to cure or to alleviate; so that we are left to infer that the
person simply submitted to the operation from purely cosmetic reasons.
The Hebrews of Palestine, after the Roman conquest, or those in Italy or
Spain, attempted a like operation, but not from any reason of lessened
health or to restore any lacking physiological action, their aim having
simply been to hide their identity, for the purpose of escaping
persecutions, exactions, or annoyances, either from their rulers or
their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>Dr. A. B. Arnold, in a paper on circumcision, read before the Academy of
Medicine of Baltimore, argues that it is not difficult to divine the
purposes of the prepuce, holding that it is necessary to protect the
tactile sensibility of the glans, due to the presence of the Pacinian
bodies which Schweigger Seidel discovered in the nerves, and that a
better provision than the anatomy of the prepuce cannot be conceived for
shielding the very vascular and sensitive structure of the glans from
external sources of irritation and friction, that might rouse the
sensibility of this organ, which, on physiological grounds, may cause
early masturbation; further arguing that, the corona being undoubtedly
the most excitable part of the glans, its denudation by circumcision
leaves it more apt to be affected by chance titillations.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
In this latter view of the case the preponderance of views is, however,
in the opposite direction. J. Royes Bell states that, owing to the
induration of the glans through the means of circumcision, masturbation
and syphilis are less rife amongst the circumcised than amongst the
uncircumcised.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
M. Lallemand, whose <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
experience in the treatment of seminal emissions is of the greatest
value, looked upon circumcision as one of the means of curing those
diseases, looking on the diminished irritability of the glans resulting
from the operation as the curative element.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
Dr. Cahen, in a &ldquo;Dissertation sur la Circoncision,&rdquo; in 1816,
before the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, called the attention to the
diminished sensibility of the glans induced by circumcision. Dr. Vanier,
of Havre, looks upon the prepuce as the most frequent cause of onanism.
&ldquo;If the prepuce is lax, its mobility produces an irritation to the
highly irritable and sensitive nervous system of the child by the
titillation in its movements on the glans; if too tight and constricted,
then it compresses the glans, and by its irritation it leads the child
to seize the organ.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
So that in either case he looks upon the prepuce, through the
sensitiveness it retains and induces in the glans, as the principle
cause of masturbation. M. Debreyne, the Trappist monk and physician of
La Trappe, who has paid considerable attention to medicine as applied to
morality, practically makes the same observations. In children who have
not yet the suggestions of sexual desire imparted by the presence of the
spermatic fluid, the presence of the prepuce seems to anticipate those
promptings. Circumcised boys may, in individual cases, either through
precept or example, physical or mental imperfection, be found to
practice onanism, but in general the practice can be asserted as being
very rare among the children of circumcised races, showing the less
irritability of the organs in the class; neither in infancy are they as
liable to priapism during sleep as those that are uncircumcised.</p>

<p>Dr. Bernheim says that &ldquo;the prepuce may be said in general to be
an appendage to man, if not positively <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
harmful in some cases, at least useless, requiring constant care, the
neglect of which is liable to entail disease and suffering; the
irritation it produces through the sebaceous secretion is a frequent
cause of masturbation which nothing short of circumcision will
remedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through middle life, unless the prepuce be the subject of some vicious
conformation, little inconvenience may result from its presence, except
it be from the dangers to infections already pointed out during this
period of life; an ordinarily movable and retractable prepuce will not
acquire the condition of phimosis, unless it be through disease or
accident; but with our entrance into old age, or after having passed our
vigorous prime, the torment of the days of our infancy and childhood
come to harass us again. Persons given to corpulency, with a long
prepuce, are apt to become affected with phimosis in their latter years,
as such persons are more subject to loss of their sexual vigor and power
of erection than lean and spare people; in these, the gradual diminution
of the size of the erectile tissues of the organ and its retraction
allows of the reconstriction of the preputial opening, which, in the
end, will not allow the prepuce to be drawn back over the gland. These
conditions are followed by the irritating affections incident to
phimosis of our earlier life, with the modification that age has induced
in making us subject to more serious and fatal ailments, both locally
and generally.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>The Prepuce, Phimosis, and Cancer.</span></h2>

<p>In the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of January 7, 1882, there is an
interesting article by Jonathan Hutchinson on the &ldquo;Pre-cancerous
Stage of Cancer.&rdquo; In this article he states that, whereas, twenty
years previously, his suggestion had been to treat all suspicious sores
as being due to syphilis until a clearer diagnosis could be made out, he
&ldquo;had more recently often explained and enforced the doctrine of a
pre-cancerous stage of cancer. According to this doctrine, in most cases
of cancer, either of penis, lips, tongue, or skin, there is a
stage&mdash;often a long one&mdash;during which a condition of chronic
inflammation only is present, and upon this the cancerous process
becomes ingrafted. Phimosis and the consequent balanitis lead to cancer
of the penis.... A general acceptance of the belief that cancer usually
has a pre-cancerous stage, and that this stage is the one in which
operations ought to be performed, would save many hundreds of lives
every year.... Instead of looking on whilst the fire <ins class='corr'
title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;smoulderd&rsquo;.">smouldered</ins>, and waiting till it blazed up, we
should stamp it out on the first suspicion.... What is a man the worse
if you have cut away a warty sore from his lip; and, when all is done, a
zealous pathologist demonstrates to you that the ulcer is not cancerous,
need your conscience be troubled? You have operated in a pre-cancerous
stage, and you have probably effected a permanent cure of what would
soon have become an incurable disease. I do not wish to offer any
apology for carelessness, but I have not in this matter any fear for
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
In view of the great frequency of the occurrence of cancer of the penis,
and the facts pointed out by Roux, that, after the removal of the
cancerous prepuce or a portion of the penis for cancer, in case of a
recurrence the disease does not do so in the penis, but that it attacks
the inguinal glands, showing conclusively that the prepuce is the
inciting cause as well as the initial point of attack, the sentiments in
the foregoing paragraph, taken from the words of Hutchinson, are worthy
of our most careful consideration.</p>

<p>M. Roux, Surgeon to the Charit&eacute;, during the second decade of the present
century, first called the attention of the French profession to the
intimate relation or dependence that cancer of the penis bears to
phimosis. In England he was preceded in this field of surgical
investigation by William Hey, whom Roux met in London in 1814. Hey had
then operated by amputation of the penis on twelve cases of cancer, nine
of whom had had phimosis at the time of the development of the cancer.
Wadd at this time also published a work on the subject, but, although he
noticed that phimosis was a cause of cancer, he did not fully grasp the
subject as Hey and Roux had done, as he believed a cancerous diathesis a
primary necessity, and did not then recognize that the primary cause was
fully to be found in the prepuce itself.</p>

<p>Roux was probably the first to point out the peculiarly local character
of penile cancer, as there is no locality wherein a timely operation is
less apt to be followed by a recurrence. He records a number of cases
where the prepuce alone was affected when first seen, but none wherein
the glans was attacked and where the prepuce <ins class='corr'
title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;wes&rsquo;.">was</ins> exempt, giving ample evidence of the original
starting-point of the disease.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Erichsen also remarks on the little liability to recurrence of cancer of
the penis after a timely operation; he divides the cancer to which the
penis is subject to as being of two distinct kinds,&mdash;scirrhus and
epithelioma. The latter variety commences as a tubercle in the prepuce,
and, according to Erichsen, does not occur in the body of the penis
except as a secondary infiltration or deposit.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Travers states that Jews who are circumcised are not subject to either
form of cancer.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Repeated attacks of herpes preputialis and some consequent point of
induration are looked upon by Petit-Radel, Chauvin, and Bernard as
frequent starting-points for the cancerous affection of the prepuce. The
aged or persons of lax fibre being more subject to these inflammatory
attacks, are also the most frequent victims of cancer in this situation.
The celebrated Lallemand, in regard to the tendency to cancer induced by
the presence of the prepuce, observes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides simple balanitis ... there also result various
indurations, which are proportionate in their degree to the length or
time and intensity with which the inciting inflammatory conditions have
existed. I have repeatedly found the mucous lining of the prepuce
thickened, hardened, ulcerated, and nodulated; at other times converted
into a fibrous or even into cartilaginous tissue of excessive thickness;
in others, still, in which it had assumed a scirrhous and cancerous
nature. I have repeatedly operated on such cases, wherein the
prolongation of the prepuce was the only recognized primary cause, the
subjects being often countrymen of from fifty to sixty years of age, who
had never known any women except their own, but who had, nevertheless,
been long sufferers from balanitic attacks, accompanied by abundant
acrid discharges, swellings of the prepuce, with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
more or less consequent excoriations and narrowing of the preputial
orifice.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Clapar&egrave;de sums up the inconveniences and dangers to which the possessor
of a prepuce is liable to suffer from, as follows: &ldquo;The retention
of the sebaceous secretion is liable to alter its character, converting
it into an acrid, irritating discharge, which induces more or less
burning, smarting, itching, excoriations, and swelling, which, affecting
the little glands situated about the corona and sulcus, induces them to
secrete an altered and vicious secretion. In this manner a simple
elongation of the prepuce will produce an inflammation of the surface of
the glans (balanitis), or that of the prepuce itself (posthitis), or the
two conjoined (balano-posthitis), complicated possibly with phimosis. By
an extension to the mucous membrane of the urethra of the same condition
of the inflammatory process, we have blennorrhagia; blennorrhagia is
liable to be followed by inguinal swellings or tenderness, orchitis,
stricture, and prostatic disease; the formation of preputial calculus,
from retention of the urine in the prepuce; and cancer is apt to be the
end of any of these conditions.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>J. Royes Bell, in Ashhurst&rsquo;s &ldquo;International Encyclop&aelig;dia of
Surgery,&rdquo; observes as follows: &ldquo;Carcinoma attacking the
genital organs usually assumes the form of epithelioma; the other kinds
are rarely met with. Epithelioma may invade the prepuce, or the whole
penis, or any part of it. The most common age for it is fifty years or
over. In the great majority of cases there has existed a congenital or
acquired phimosis. A contusion or a urinary fistula may be the exciting
cause. With a phimosis the parts are not kept clean, but the gland is
macerated and rendered tender and excoriated by retained secretions, and
the irritation causes an epithelioma <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to grow in those predisposed to the disease, as is found to be the case
when the tongue is irritated by a broken tooth, or the scrotum by the
presence of soot in its folds. Syphilis has no direct influence in
inducing the disease, but a syphilitic chap or ulcer may be the
starting-point of an epithelioma. Two kinds of epithelioma affect the
penis,&mdash;the indurated and the vegetating, or cauliflower growth....
The nature of the disease, in either the prepuce or the glans, is masked
by a phimosis.... The prognosis in these cases is much more hopeful than
in epithelioma, in other situations.... Sir William Lawrence operated on
a patient who was quite well years afterward, and Sir William Ferguson
amputated the penis of a man of note in the political world, who lived
many years after the operation, and died at an advanced age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agnew, of Philadelphia, describes an epithelioma of the prepuce
occurring in persons past middle life, beginning as a tubercle, crack,
or wart, for which he advises an early circumcision; he admits, however,
to not having sufficient data to determine whether Jews and circumcised
persons are exempt from carcinoma of the penis; but as its usual
starting-point he evidently admits to be in the prepuce, circumcision
must certainly be a preventive to its appearance. Gross gives
substantially the same opinion as Agnew in this regard. Dr. John S.
Billings, in his article on the &ldquo;Vital Statistics of the
Jews,&rdquo; in the January <i>North American Review</i>, of 1891, on the
subject of cancer, observes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As regards cancer and malignant tumors, we find that the deaths
from these causes among the Hebrews occur in about the same proportion
to deaths from other diseases as they do in the average population.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
But as the ratio of deaths to population is less among the Jews, so the
ratio of deaths from malignant diseases to population is also less.
Among the living population the proportion found affected with cancer
among the Jews was 6.48 per 1000, while of those reported sick by the
United States census of 1880, for the general population, the proportion
was 10.01 per 1000.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are no convenient data as to the prevalence or percentage of cases
of cancer among the Arabian or Mohammedan population of Asia and Africa,
but the above comparison of 6.48 per 1000 among the Jews of the United
States, against 10.01 per 1000 of the general population, shows that the
circumcised race does, in the instance of cancer, certainly enjoy a
certain amount of immunity, having in this regard not quite such an
exemption as they enjoy from consumption, but still sufficient to assist
in making them longer-lived and more able to enjoy life and die a less
lingering and painful death.</p>

<p>It is surprising that, in view of the fact that carcinoma of the penis,
starting with such frequency in the prepuce, should have left any doubt
but that with the absence of this appendage there would follow less
liability to cancer. Cullerier informs us that he had several times
amputated the penis for cancerous diseases, but that he is unable to
tell us whether the persons were affected with phimosis, remarking that
on the last case he had observed the indurated remains of the prepuce;
he had, however, recognized the necessity of freely exposing the gland
in cases where, from continued irritation and inflammation, there was
danger of cancer formation.</p>

<p>Nelaton describes two varieties of cancer that affect the penis,&mdash;that
which attacks the integument and that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
which attacks the glans. The first of these varieties he observes as
generally beginning as a hardened nodule in the prepuce, which becomes
at once more or less thickened and indurated. He gives Lisfranc the
credit of pointing out the fact, that, even in the most hopeless-looking
case, the glans and body of the penis may be simply pushed back and
compressed, but otherwise sound, and that before resorting to an
amputation of the whole organ it is better to make a careful exploratory
dissection in search of the penis, as it oftentimes happens that the
prepuce and integument can be dissected off, leaving the organ intact.
He also mentions that elephantiasis of the penile integument generally
begins in the prepuce.</p>

<p>Baron Boyer believed that the vitiated preputial secretion allowed to
remain beneath the prepuce was one of the causes of cancer of the penis,
observing that it would be interesting to know whether cancer of the
penis was a rarity among circumcised people, such as the Jews and
Mohammedans.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to perceive why or how Agnew, Gross, Cullerier, and many of
those who have written on the subject, have failed to appreciate the
existence of the prepuce as an exciting cause, or as being, in the
majority of instances, the part primarily attacked. The nodule,
excoriation, or abrasion that develops into a cancer generally produces
more or less local disturbance; in many it produces a phimosis that is
only relieved by the ulcerative process that exposes the gland, which
may by that time itself be attacked or even destroyed. They are then
seen by either the rural practitioner or the family physician, but
before submitting to an operation they run the gauntlet of many
physicians, and, when it comes to operating, they generally apply to
some one of great <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
skill and reputation. By this time there is little left of the organ,
and, as a rule, the party is unable to tell where the disease
originated, whether in the prepuce or glans, to them the swollen prepuce
seeming to be the whole organ. Of late years, however, it has been
pretty well established that it generally begins in the prepuce, and the
great number of amputations of the penis on record for this disease does
not lead one to believe that it is as rare a disease as was formerly
believed. In Langenbeck&rsquo;s <i>Archiv</i>, Bd. xii, 1870, Dr. Zielewicz
reports fifty cases of amputation of the penis by the galvano-cautery
loop, mostly for carcinoma, one of the fifty being for gangrene and one
other for a large papillary tumor. That one surgeon was able to report
forty-eight cases of carcinoma or cancer that were treated by one
special system of operating tells us plainly enough that the unfortunate
possessor of a prepuce, no matter how normal or unobjectionable it may
seem to be in the prime of man&rsquo;s existence, or however
physiologically necessary it may be deemed, runs too many risks in
holding on to his possessions.</p>

<p>The views set forth by Hutchinson in the beginning of this chapter are
precisely those that are held by the writer, who would even go further,
by advising all such as have, in their youth or since, suffered with
balano-posthitis in any degree or form, or whose prepuce shows a
tendency to elongation with age, to have the same removed at once; where
the prepuce is not redundant, but only tight, a slight operation, such
as slitting, will at once remove the possibility of any future danger,
without keeping a man from his business a single day.</p>

<p>It may here be remarked that, although always favorably impressed with
the great benefits arising out of circumcision, nothing ever resulted in
such a serious <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
consideration of the subject as seeing a professional brother dying
with a cancerous affection of the penis. The disease had originated in
the mucous lining of the prepuce, and when seen in consultation with his
attending physicians the gland had already disappeared and the inguinal
glands were affected. The man was in the prime of life, and, aside from
the local trouble, a specimen of perfect health and physique. He
informed us that while a youth he had suffered from repeated attacks of
herpes preputialis; that he had suggested circumcision more than once to
his father, who also was a physician, but who, unfortunately for the
son, could not see any merit in circumcision. To his eyes there was
nothing that circumcision could do but what could be accomplished by
washing and personal attention to cleanliness. When older, the prepuce
gave him less trouble, and for a long time after his marriage it ceased
to trouble him altogether. The idea of the necessity of circumcision did
not occur to him again until the appearance of the cancerous disease;
even then, not appreciating the danger, and looking upon the trouble as
a simple transient result of some inflammatory action, he waited until
the parts would be in a better state or condition of health before
resorting to an operation,&mdash;that time never came.</p>

<p>Although to Roux, Wadd, and Hey the credit must be given for bringing
the subject of cancer of this organ so prominently before the
profession, the knowledge of the existence of the disease has long been
a matter of record. Patissier, in the fortieth volume of the
&ldquo;Dict. des Sciences M&eacute;dicales,&rdquo; quotes from the third volume
of the &ldquo;M&eacute;moires de l&rsquo;Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Chirurgie,&rdquo;
that in 1724 an officer, aged fifty, was attacked by a cancerous
affection originating underneath the prepuce; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
at the time he consulted MM. Chicoineau and Sonlier the disease had
existed for two years, the inguinal glands were implicated, and even the
suspensory ligament was affected. These surgeons, nevertheless,
determined upon an operation, and, after a long chapter of
h&aelig;morrhagic accidents, the patient finally made a recovery.
Another case, quoted by Patissier, was operated upon by M. Ceyrac de la
Coste, the patient a man of sixty, the disease originating, like the
preceding case, underneath the prepuce.</p>

<p>Warren, in his &ldquo;Surgical Observations on Tumors,&rdquo; observes
that cancer of the penis begins by a warty excrescence on the glans or
prepuce. Walshe, in his work on the &ldquo;Nature and Treatment of
Cancer,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The disease may commence in almost all parts
of the organ, but the glans and prepuce are by far its most common
primary seats. It may originate either from a warty excrescence or a
pimple, or it may infiltrate the glans, or appear as a complication of
venereal ulceration. Phimosis, either congenital or acquired, is an
exceedingly common accompaniment, and it appears probable that the
irritation occasioned by this condition of the parts may act as an
exciting cause of the disease in persons predisposed to cancer.
Circumcision is, therefore, an advisable prophylactic measure, where the
constitutional taint is known to exist.&rdquo;</p>

<hr /><p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>The Prepuce and Gangrene of the Penis.</span></h2>

<p>Another accompaniment of that preputial appendage is gangrene of the
penis, which, like carcinoma, starting in at the prepuce, may invade the
pubes and scrotum. This disease is not so rare as to merit the little
attention it has received from our text-books. M. Demarquay has
collected the history of twenty-five cases; from him we learn that the
prepuce is the most frequent seat of the start of the affection, from
whence, according to Astruc, it rapidly spreads to the skin of the whole
organ, and then attacks the corpora cavernosa; it may even extend as
high as the umbilicus. This disease spares no age; it attacks young and
old alike.</p>

<p>There is not a case recorded of this disease that particularized any
other starting-point than the swelling, tension, active or passive
congestion that takes place in the integument of the penis. By this it
must not be understood that the initial disease or inflammatory action
that produces the gangrene must necessarily have its seat in the
integument, but that it is the integument of the penis (and especially
that of the prepuce) in which, through the laxity of its tissues,
passive congestion is favored that the gangrenous action begins. That
this is the actual case there can be but little doubt about, as, even
where the gangrene invades the body of the penis itself, even where the
inflammatory action may have started from a violent urethritis, that
condition of blood which favors gangrenous results <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
will be found to have begun during its state of stasis, where it has
parted with much of its watery element, as well as considerable of its
vitality, while in its slow, tedious, and obstructed passage through the
prepuce. Some of this dark, thickish blood, finding its way from the
integumentary return circulation to that of the deeper structure,
becomes there a mechanical as well as a pathological cause for that
impediment to the free circulation of the parts, through its altered
physiological condition. The deeper structures of the penis, besides
their own blood-supply, carry back into the deeper or systemic
circulation a large supply from the integumentary <ins class='corr'
title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;tisses&rsquo;.">tissues</ins>, when in the latter, owing to the greater
supply due to any inflammatory action, the blood-current is delayed and
impeded in its lax and easily-dilatable tissues, and blood-changes occur
favoring the gangrene in the deeper tissues, so that, whether the
gangrene first takes place in the body of the penis or in the scrotum,
it will be in the prepuce or adjoining integument that its real
originating causes will be found.</p>

<p>Baron Boyer, in speaking of the inflammation of the penis, observes that
the intensity of the swelling, great pain, and difficulty of urination
that follow have led many to believe that the inflammation of the deeper
structures really always formed a part of the disease. In otherwise
healthy and vigorous subjects it does not, however, extend beyond the
skin, as has been demonstrated where the resulting gangrene from excess
of inflammatory action has ended in resolution, the deeper tissues not
having been found to be injured. It is only where the tone of the
general system is lowered, through disease, age, or other deteriorating
conditions, that the whole organ is liable to become affected or to
break down.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Boyer, in the tenth volume of his &ldquo;Treatise on Surgical
Affections,&rdquo; gives several examples of this affection not due to
age: one case was a person, simultaneously attacked by an adynamic fever
and a blennorrhagia, who suffered from gangrene of the penis; the local
and constitutional disturbance was not high, however, and the patient
escaped with the simple loss of the prepuce.</p>

<p>Another case admitted to the Charit&eacute;, aged thirty-six, was afflicted
with a blennorrhagia, upon which an attack of low fever supervened. The
penis inflamed, became engorged and livid, and soon gangrenous symptoms
presented themselves, making rapid progress; at first the integument
alone was affected, but later all the structures became implicated and
the penis was completely destroyed, the sloughs detaching themselves in
shreds, leaving a conical stump that healed but slowly.</p>

<p>One case, a young man of twenty, also at the Charit&eacute;, was admitted with
adynamic fever; a few days after admission the prepuce was observed to
be somewhat inflamed; in spite of all treatment this progressed so
rapidly that the purple discoloration presaged a gangrene, which was not
slow in following; the focus seemed to be at the superior and back
portion of the prepuce; an incision evacuated a quantity of purulent,
serous fluid; the disease, however, extended up the organ as far as its
middle before its actions ceased; the sloughs were then cast off, when
it was found that part of the gland and a portion of the cavernous body
had followed the integument in the general wreck, subjecting the patient
to intolerable pain during micturition. After the recovery from the
fever, the remaining portion of the gland and the mutilated parts of the
cavernous body were amputated to remedy this condition; the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
patient subsequently admitted to have had a blennorrhagia at the time
of his admission to the hospital.</p>

<p>The gangrenous action may, in proportion to the low condition of the
patient, be as proportionately rapid. Another case from Boyer, quoted
from the works of Forestus, relates how the whole organ underwent such
speedy disorganization that its liquefied remains were found in a
poultice, which had been applied with a view of relieving the
congestion,&mdash;a very dear price to pay for retaining the prepuce, that
the exquisite sensitiveness of the tactile faculty for enjoyment,
resident in the corona of the gland, might not be interfered with.</p>

<p>Gross does not mention this affection in his work on surgery, <ins
class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;dut&rsquo;.">but</ins> Agnew devotes considerable space to its
description, dividing the disease into two forms: the inflammatory, such
as may follow venereal primary sores or operations on the penis, not
excepting circumcision; and the obstructive variety, such as may follow
embolism or any mechanical obstruction, either purposely or accidentally
applied. Of the latter he gives a number of quoted instances; he only
admits seeing one case, that of an aged man in the Pennsylvania
Hospital, in whom the disease was caused by embolism of the dorsal
artery.</p>

<p>J. Royes Bell, in the &ldquo;International Encyclop&aelig;dia of
Surgery,&rdquo; pays more attention to it than any of our American
authors; mentioning, among the causes which may give rise to it, the
exanthemata, especially small-pox, and the poisoning by ergot of rye and
erysipelas. Among the local causes lie mentions phimosis, paraphimosis,
and balano-posthitis.</p>

<p>Bell quotes the case reported by Mr. Partridge, in the sixteenth volume
of the &ldquo;Transactions of the Pathological Society of London,&rdquo;
wherein a sober man, aged <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
forty, lost the whole of his penis up to the root, during the course of
a typhus fever. Also the case reported by Mr. Gay, in the thirtieth
volume of the same &ldquo;Transactions,&rdquo; wherein a cabinet-maker,
aged thirty-one, lost his penis through the probable results of
rheumatic phlebitis, and due to the presence of a plug in the internal
iliac vein. In the twelfth volume of the &ldquo;Transactions&rdquo; of
the same society he finds the record of the case of a soldier who lost
his penis through gangrene induced by syphilitic phagedena.</p>

<p>In the consideration of the subject of the prepuce as connected with
penile gangrene, it must not be overlooked that the presence of a
prepuce may be the inciting cause of some rheumatic affection (the
writer has repeatedly seen such), just as such cases are often the
result of stricture; as cases of rheumatism that have resisted all
remedial means, but that have readily given way to the dilatation of a
stricture, are by no means uncommon; not a mere muscular reflex
rheumatic pain, but even when accompanied by a rheumatic blood
condition. So that even in such a case as above reported as being due to
rheumatic phlebitis, or the case reported in the fortieth volume of the
&ldquo;Dictionaire des Sciences M&eacute;dicales&rdquo; by Patissier, wherein a
man lost penis and scrotum through gangrene, induced by urinous
infiltration, may all in the origin be due, if not to the immediate, to
the remote effects of the presence of the prepuce.</p>

<p>In the first volume of the <i>Journal of Venereal and Cutaneous Diseases</i>
the writer reported a case of the complete loss of penis in a young man
as a result of phagedena due to syphilis. The man had had a long and
pendulous prepuce; in his case, had circumcision been performed in early
childhood, it would have lessened the chances of primary infection, and
had it been <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
performed after his infection, it would have removed one cause&mdash;if
not the principal cause&mdash;of the ease with which the phagedenic
action was inaugurated. The case already mentioned as an example of
spontaneous and natural circumcision belongs to the gangrenous results
following phimosis, ending with the loss of the prepuce. In
Maclise&rsquo;s &ldquo;Surgical Anatomy&rdquo; several specimens of
deformity are figured, showing the results of this mildest of the
effects of a phagedenic action. The beginning of the interference in the
return preputial circulation undoubtedly always takes place over the
superior aspect of the corona, where the pressure of the glans is most
sharply defined against the inner fold of the prepuce.</p>

<p>There are milder conditions, wherein the circulation of the prepuce is
materially interfered with, both through the lax tissues of the parts
and the peculiar anatomical construction and shape of the neighboring
parts, wherein, without going as far as gangrenous breakdown, the person
suffers considerably nevertheless, and is placed in danger of losing his
penis; for, as observed by Patissier, whenever a person affected with a
gonorrh&oelig;a is attacked by a putrid or any low-grade fever, he runs the
greatest danger of losing his virile member through gangrene.</p>

<p>Even where phimosis does not exist, but only the long, lax, and
retractable prepuce, that is considered a perfectly physiological
condition, the prepuce is liable to cause very distressing and
complicating annoyances during the progress of other diseases. The
writer has noticed that cases with a thick, leathery, and redundant
prepuce, even when perfectly retractable, are more liable to require the
use of the catheter during the course of a continued fever. Such a
condition is also a very frequent <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
accompaniment of prostatic obstruction. So often has this been noticed
that its association with prostatic trouble or disease tends to the
belief that the irritation produced by this condition of prepuce often
lays the foundation for prostatic disease in not a few cases.<a
name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a
href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In elderly people, with
the atrophied penis and elongating prepuce, the constant moisture from
the urine on the <ins class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The
original showed &lsquo;innner&rsquo;.">inner</ins> fold and glans adds greatly
to the irritation as well as to the discomfort of the patient.</p>

<p>A number of affections are accompanied by &oelig;dema, especially toward
the latter stages of the disease; such, for instance, as the ending of
cases of mitral insufficiency. In these, the distension of the prepuce
and the resulting balano-posthitis is at times a source of great
distress, and at times the resulting engorgement produces a retention of
urine. It was after an attendance on one such case that required daily
and frequent puncturings for its relief, but which, in spite of all
care, finally became gangrenous, that a fellow practitioner cheerfully
submitted to circumcision, to avoid the possibility of any such
complication occurring to embitter his closing illness.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>The prepuce is the starting-point of many of the cases of penitis and
retention of urine that often accompany attacks of gonorr&oelig;a;
especially can this result be anticipated where the prepuce is long,
pendulous, and with its veins in a varicose condition. Why it should be
so is self-evident. Anything that will add to the interference of the
return circulation only exaggerates the tendency to penis engorgement;
this increases the difficulty of urination, which, by the retention that
results, in turn increases the constriction at the root of the penis,
and adds to the already difficult return circulation. The bladder by its
urine, and the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
penis by its blood, actually form, by their mutual pressures, an
impassable dam at the root of the organ. That this is the true condition
has been more than once verified from the instant relief given to the
whole condition by the prompt employment of the supra-pubic puncture or
aspiration, as catheterization in such cases is altogether out of the
question, and should never be attempted or employed unless a soft
catheter can be inserted.</p>

<p>A person laboring under a continued fever has his blood in a condition
to favor sphacelus; with the slow-moving current of vitiated blood and
its retention in such lax tissues as those of the prepuce, through the
medium of the enlarged preputial veins, coupled with the lessened
sensibilities of the bladder and his perhaps semi-conscious or
unconscious condition, and an equally unconscious bladder, he is, to say
the least of it,&mdash;if in possession of a prepuce,&mdash;also the unconscious
possessor of a certain degree of percentage, no matter how small or
fractional that may be, of recovering from his fever without his penis.
Dr. W. W. McKay, of the U. S. Marine Hospital Service of San Diego,
attended a case of typho-malarial fever in consultation with me, where,
but for the persistent, intelligent, but delicate use of the catheter
for nearly three weeks the penis would have become gangrenous. The
subject was an ur&aelig;mic, irritable, nervous, leathery-prepuced individual;
the organ was unusually large, the skin of the penis thick, and it was
only by keeping the bladder empty that prevented a state of engorgement
that would have effectually interfered with further catheterization. As
it was, the penis was often dank, livid, and discolored from the passive
engorgement.</p>

<p>The writer saw a similar case with the late Dr. F. H.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> Milligan, of
Minnesota. The congestion in this case was due to a gonorrh&oelig;al
inflammation involving the skin of the whole penis, retention having
followed painful micturition, and the swelling of the penis following
the retention; the prepuce was enormously distended, and the penis
seemed in a state of erection as far as dimension and rigidity were
concerned. The man, a steam-boat cook, informed us that it was fully
twice as large as when rigidly erect in health. All efforts to reduce
the swelling were unavailing; neither punctures, leeches, nor
scarifications were of any avail; catheterization was impossible, but,
after relieving the bladder by the supra-pubic aspiration, the patient
experienced some relief. He, nevertheless, lost the whole skin of the
penis, with that of the pubis and on the front of the scrotum. The man
ran into a low form of fever, with ur&aelig;mic symptoms; the stench was so
great that it was almost impossible to remain in the same room with him;
but he finally made a slow and very tedious recovery. In healing there
was considerable downward curvature of the penis, which, however, did
not prevent him from following his old, dissolute course of life.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>A calm, unprejudiced consideration of the subject of the liability of
the uncircumcised races dwelling in the temperate and semi-tropical
countries to cancer, gangrene, and elephantiasis might well lead one to
ask: Why are we afflicted with a prepuce? We can understand how a man
may become gouty, and become a subject in the end for a gangrene of the
extremities; or how senile gangrene may, through a series of
pathological processes and blood changes, with the aid of age, finally
be reached; or how, by a like course of diseased processes, we reach the
apoplectic stage. These conditions, however, can be put off, or partly,
if not wholly avoided, by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
a proper course of life, and, at the worst, it is only after the fires
of our youth and prime have completely burned out, that these conditions
are liable to claim us as their lawful victim. Not so, however, with
some of these conditions that may end in penile gangrene; that are
liable to pounce upon us unawares, like an Apache in an Arizona
ca&ntilde;on; or as the hired mercenaries of old Canon Fulbert did upon
poor Abelard in his study, and, without further ado or ceremony
emasculate man as effectually as the most exacting Turk could demand,
with a veritable <i>taill&egrave; &agrave; fleur de ventre</i> operation.</p>

<p>Nature has her own ways of protecting what there is of any utility;
there is a law of the survival of the fittest that we all appreciate.
If, then, this penile appendage is of any utility, why is it that,
unlike the rest of the body, it falls such an easy victim to gangrene?
The procreative function seems to be, in a sense, one of the main cares
of nature in its relation to the animal as well as the vegetable
kingdom; but here is a useless bit of skin, adipose tissue, mucous
membrane, and some connective tissue, that on the least provocation is
liable to go off into a gangrene and drag one of the main generative, or
even all the procreative, apparatus into the general wreck. Nature
certainly never intended anything of the kind. To be generous, and not
libel nature, we must conclude that the prepuce is a near relative to
the fast-disappearing climbing-muscle; very useful in our primitive,
arboreal days, when we needed such a muscle to reach our perch for the
night, and a prepuce or something of the kind, in default of a
breech-cloth, to protect the glans penis from being scratched by the
briars or thorny and rough bark of the trees in our ascent. The prepuce
was well enough in our primitive and arboreal days,&mdash;ages and ages ahead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of our cave and lake dwellings,&mdash;when the notch in a tree and its
rough bark formed our couch; but in these days of plush-cushioned pews
and opera-seats, cosy office-chairs, car-seats, and upholstered
furniture or polished-oak seats, it serves no intelligent purpose.</p>

<p>Emasculation has never been looked upon with favor by its victim, and it
would be but natural to suppose that man would take every precaution
against the accidental occurrence of such an undesired condition. The
writer well remembers that, in his &ldquo;Tom Sawyer&rdquo; days on the
banks of the upper Mississippi, in the happy days of the crack rafting
crews, before the introduction of the towage steamer, when the river
towns were more or less terrorized by wild gangs of these men, some of
whom were always fighting and quarreling and drinking when not at work.
In the lot there was one man with a great reputation at a
rough-and-tumble fight. His main hold was that he generally tried to
emasculate his adversary by destroying the physiological condition of
the testicle. The man was not a large or powerful man, nor was he a
great boxer or wrestler, but this reputation made him feared by all the
bullies on the river. The report that not a few who had tackled him had
subsequently been of no value, either as fornicators or fecundators, or
had to be castrated on account of the resulting testicular degeneration,
seemed in no way to encourage any one to wish to meet him in a personal
encounter. It would seem as if the desire to avoid such an
accident&mdash;provided persons knew the dangers that lurk in a
prepuce&mdash;would induce many to submit to circumcision. That many more do
not do so can only be attributed to the general human wish to escape a
less present evil for a greater unknown one, being evidently deterred by
the prospective pain that must be suffered immediately.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
There is a question that should interest man above that of the simple
loss of penis. It appears that there is a powerful moral effect that
follows this loss, as might, in the majority, be anticipated. According
to the experience of Civiale, many who have lost the penis, through
amputation for disease or through disease itself, end in suicide. He
mentions particularly a patient at the Charit&eacute; who had lost his penis,
who, finding no other means to take himself off, saved up sufficient
opium, from that given him to calm his pains, to take all at one dose
and commit suicide. In the London <i>Lancet</i> for March 27, 1886, there is
reported a discussion on this subject, to which the reader is referred,
as it fully covers the moral and physical effects of castration and
penis amputation for disease. M. Roux, who amputated the penis of a
brother of Buffon, in 1810, reported that, in that case, M. Buffon lost
none of his customary gayety.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>The Prepuce, Calculi, and Other Annoyances.</span></h2>

<p>From an article published in the New York <i>Medical Times</i> of March,
1872, from the pen of Dr. J. G. Kerr, of Canton, China, we learn that
phimosis is not an uncommon occurrence among the Chinese. As has been
demonstrated by C. H. Mastin, of Mobile, climate is a great factor of
calculus. (&ldquo;Transactions International Medical Congress&rdquo; of
1876, page 609.) That of China seems a most favorable climate in this
regard; so that, between the prevalence of phimosis among the Chinese
and the calculus-producing tendency of the climate, China may be said to
be the classic land of preputial calculi, as England is that of the
gout, or the United States that of delirium tremens. From Dr. Kerr we
learn that the occurrence of these concretions were, as a rule,
multiple, and that in two cases that fell under his observation the
number of stones from each individual exceeded one hundred. In one case
there were forty, and in three cases there were between twenty and
thirty. These were of different sizes and weight, some being an inch and
five-eighths in diameter, and from that size down to where one hundred
and sixteen taken from one individual case only weighed one ounce. The
tendency to calculous disease in that climate may well be imagined, when
the same observer relates a case of urinary infiltration into the skin
on the under side of the penis that gave rise to the formation of a
collection of calculi in that locality, four of which were the size of
pigeons&rsquo; eggs; and another case in which a urinary fistula
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
induced the formation of a calculus in the groin, near the scrotum, the
calculus weighing two and a half drachms and measuring one and a half
inches by three-quarters of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>Clapar&egrave;de mentions a case in the practice of M. Dum&egrave;ril, in which the
stone extracted from the prepuce weighed two hundred and twenty-five
grammes, or about eight ounces. Civiale speaks of a young man of twenty
with phimosis, who, after practicing sexual connection for the first
time, experienced pain and a purulent discharge, from whom, on
examination, he removed five stones as large as prunes. The patient had
felt them in their position, but had imagined the condition to be a
natural one.</p>

<p>E. L. Keyes gives their composition as being of calcified smegma, urate
of ammonium, triple and earthy phosphates and mucus, and as symptoms and
results: pain, purulent discharges, interference with urination and the
sexual act, involuntary emission, ulceration of the preputial cavity,
and impotence.</p>

<p>Enoch mentions a child of two years in the Charit&eacute;, who, being operated
upon for phimosis, was found to have a preputial calculus occluding the
urethral meatus. At the autopsy a calculus as large as an egg was found
in the bladder.</p>

<p>The presence of these formations, although not necessarily dangerous in
themselves, may, by their effects and in the irritation they induce, be
the means of producing serious mischief. The only preventive or remedy
for this condition is circumcision.</p>

<p>Acquired phimosis has been mentioned as a result of inflammatory lotion,
such as is connected with balano-posthitis; it sometimes happens that,
the act of coitus being done forcibly, especially with public women, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
are apt to use very astringent and constricting washes, the prepuce
becomes injured, with the result of producing a phimosis. One man will
produce the same results through the means of some vaunted wash or dip
which is supposed to act as a prophylactic to any venereal infection.
One patient had developed a chronic herpetic affection by the constant
use of an iodized ointment which he regarded as an infallible
prophylactic. Many cases of phimosis result from the attending
inflammation that follows on the liberal domestic application of nitrate
of silver to an abrasion after connection, in the mistaken idea that the
party labors under, that he is destroying some venereal virus.</p>

<p>By the irritation that all these applications and accidents induce,
warts and vegetations are the but too frequent results. These I have
never seen in a circumcised individual, and their occurrence and
frequency, as well as persistency, are directly proportionate with the
degree of tightness, thickness, or redundancy of the prepuce and the
irritability of the gland. As remarked by Lallemand, in reference to the
victim of nocturnal enuresis becoming a future victim of nocturnal
emissions, so it may be said of the person subject in early life to
either warts, excoriations or vegetations on the penis, that it is this
class that furnishes in after life the subjects for cancerous disease as
well as furnishing the easiest victims for venereal infection. These
warts, although easily removed, have a tendency to recurrence,
especially as long as the moist bed that has once grown them there is
still vegetating.</p>

<p>The prepuce is liable to indurations and hypertrophy. Of the first
anomaly, the London <i>Lancet</i> of 1846 has a record of two cases in which
paraphimosis was induced in elderly subjects, and of one in which it
induced phimosis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Since then a number of cases of thickening and induration have been
reported. Hypertrophy may take place in any degree, varying from the
mere leathery and overpendulous but unobstructive prepuce to the case
recorded by Vidal, in the fifth volume of his &ldquo;Pathologie Externe
et M&eacute;decine Operatoire,&rdquo; which happened in the practice of
M. Rigal, de Gaillae. The hypertrophied prepuce was something enormous,
and hung down to below the patient&rsquo;s knees; it was pear-shaped,
with the base hanging downward; this base was as large as a man&rsquo;s
head. This prepuce was successfully removed by M. Rigal, who presented
the specimen before the Paris Surgical Society, who were then discussing
a somewhat similar but not so extensive a case, presented by M. Lenoire.
Vidal mentions having operated on a number of cases of this deformity of
the prepuce in various degrees of growth.</p>

<p>As a rule, simple hypertrophic disease of the penile integument does not
interfere with the sexual functions of the male organ after its removal;
it being susceptible of complete removal in exaggerated cases, even
without touching the body of the organ. There are exceptions to this
rule, however, when even this otherwise non-malignant disease may entail
the loss of all the genitals. In the London <i>Lancet</i> of July 11, 1846,
at page 46, there is a record of a remarkable case of this nature
reported by F. H. Brett, Esq., F.R.C.S. The case was that of a locksmith
of forty years of age, who was naturally much phimosed. The penis was
enormously enlarged, as well as the scrotum, which was more or less
ulcerated and full of sinuses filled with a serous pus; some six months
prior to the final operation, a part of the prepuce was removed to
facilitate urination, but the whole mass had to be subsequently removed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
including the whole of the skin of the penis and the scrotum, the
testicles having been carefully dissected out and recovered with some
skin flap.</p>

<p>In this case the disease was believed to have originated from a perineal
fistula. The pathological investigation in the case, however, by Mr.
Quekett, who submitted the mass to a microscopical examination,
confirmed Mr. Brett in his original opinion that the disease had the
same pathological conditions as the similar disease found in India,
where it originates from local inflammatory causes. In this case the
preputial irritation was, in all probability, the precursor of the
conditions that led to the perineal fistula, the patient having had a
stricture for some twelve years. Mr. Brett states that the man had been
abandoned by his wife on account of his previous sexual disability, and
on account, as well, of his having been incapacitated from following any
vocation. After the operation all his functions were restored and his
organs were sound.</p>

<p>Nelaton records a case reported by Wadd, in 1817, of an African negro so
affected, whose penis measured fourteen inches in length and twelve and
a half inches in circumference; also the case reported by Gibert, of
Hospital St. Louis, of a subject &ldquo;with a penis the size of a
mule&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Brett attributes the recovery of his case as being due in a great
measure to the moral support given to the patient from the knowledge
that his procreative organs were not interfered with, and on the same
grounds he attributes the great fatality previously attending the
operation to the fact that it previously had been the custom in many
cases to make a clean general <i>taill&egrave; &agrave; fleur de ventre</i>,
sacrificing all the genital organs. In simple hypertrophy, he considers
that the body of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
penis and the testicles will always be found to be in a normal
condition; a careful dissection of the parts will invariably save not
only the man&rsquo;s sexual functions, but his moral stamina, which he
sadly needs in such an emergency. In the discussion on this subject
heretofore mentioned as taking place in the London Medical Society, Mr.
Pye, Mr. John A. Morgan, and others insisted on the necessity of
retaining the testicles, whenever possible, in all these sweeping
operations upon the genitals, they being actually necessary for the
moral and physical support of man, Mr. Morgan observing that their
removal would depress parts controlled by the sympathetic system.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>Reflex Neuroses and the Prepuce.</span></h2>

<p>We have seen in the previous chapters what the immediate effects of the
prepuce may lead to; we have followed its local effects in childhood to
youth, thence into what it does in our prime, and we have seen how, when
we are on the down grade, owing to the increase of years, then, like the
minute-men of Concord, wakened up by Paul Revere&rsquo;s classic ride,
hanging on to the rear of the retreating and disheartened British, it
harasses, worries, and downs a man here and there, striking down the man
as if it had some undying, irremediable spite, which nothing but his
misery and death could alleviate. Some authorities will argue that all
that is required is cleanliness; that all men need do is to be like a
true American, with the old Continental watchword of &ldquo;eternal
vigilance is the price of liberty&rdquo; in continued active practice. A
bowlful of some antiseptic wash and a small sponge should always be at
hand, and he should be as industrious as if haltered in a tread-mill; he
should make this a part of his toilet, and his daily and hourly care.
This will, we are told, lessen his chances of becoming a victim to the
many ills that lie in wait for him, all on account of the glory, honor,
and comfort of wearing a prepuce, which is a perfectly physiological
appendage.</p>

<p>From these visible and apparently easily understood conditions and
results we are now to enter a broad field, wherein the prepuce seems to
exercise a malign influence in the most distant and apparently
unconnected manner; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
where, like some of the evil genii or sprites in the Arabian tales, it
can reach from afar the object of its malignity, striking him down
unawares in the most unaccountable manner; making him a victim to all
manner of ills, sufferings, and tribulations; unfitting him for marriage
or the cares of business; making him miserable and an object of
continual scolding and punishment in childhood, through its worriments
and nocturnal enuresis; later on, beginning to affect him with all kinds
of physical distortions and ailments, nocturnal pollutions, and other
conditions calculated to weaken him physically, mentally, and morally;
to land him, perchance, in the jail, or even in a lunatic asylum.
Man&rsquo;s whole life is subject to the capricious dispensations and
whims of this Job&rsquo;s-comforts-dispensing enemy of man.</p>

<p>As strange as it may seem, this field of knowledge, this field of misery
and suffering, disease and distortion, of physical and mental obliquity,
presided over by this preputial Afrit of malignant disposition, was an
unknown, undiscovered, and therefore unexplored region for some
thousands of years, and it remained for an American to discover and
describe this vast territorial acquisition, and to annex it to the
domain of medicine, which, through its skill, could modify the influence
of the evil genius that there presided and spare humanity much of the
ills to which it had been subjected.</p>

<p>In this regard, Louis A. Sayre was to medicine what Columbus was to
geography. Neither Strabo nor Herodotus had anything to say regarding
what existed beyond the pillars of Hercules, and neither Hippocrates nor
Galen had anything in regard to this preputial Merlin, which in their
day, even, had its existence. Neither did Tissot nor Bienville, the two
pioneers in the field of our knowledge regarding onanism and
nymphomania, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
dream of the existence of this one cause of the diseases to which they
gave so much time and study. It is only some twenty years since Louis A.
Sayre read his paper, entitled &ldquo;Partial Paralysis from Reflex
Irritation Caused by Congenital Phimosis and Adherent Prepuce,&rdquo;
before the American Medical Association. This was the starting-point
from whence the profession entered into what had previously been a
veritable &ldquo;Darkest Africa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we read that only some fifty years before the times of Columbus
Christian Europe had no lunatic asylum,&mdash;not that there was a lack of
lunatics or that the existence of lunacy was entirely ignored, but that
the then state of medicine and the general intelligence was not
emancipated from the idea of demoniacs,&mdash;and we are told that the
lunatics were in many instances hung, quartered and burned, hooted and
chased about the streets, or chained in gloomy dungeons; until, as
related by Lecky, a Spanish monk named Juan Gilaberto Joffe, filled with
compassion at the sight of the maniacs who were hooted by crowds through
the streets of Valencia, founded an asylum in that city. His movement in
this direction called the attention of the Church and people to this
class in a practical light, and from Spain a more enlightened idea in
regard to this class swept onward throughout Europe. As observed, it
seems strange to us of the present day that such ignorance in these
matters should, or could, have so long existed. It seems impossible for
us to conceive how these conditions of incoherent action and of mental
derangements could have existed and their causes have not been fully
appreciated; and yet we were not above, some twenty years ago only,
subjecting children to punishment and scoldings for being addicted to
nocturnal enuresis, or of accusing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
cases of nocturnal and involuntary emissions as being due to
masturbation. The child was allowed then to grow up paralytic, or with a
deformed limb, or continually punished to correct what was imagined to
be a condition of willful carelessness, irritability, or willful moral
perversion. Perversion, stupidity, and irritability of the mind or
temper were not known to depend, in many instances, on preputial
irritation; children were, accordingly, worried and punished for
something over which they had no earthly control or the least volition.
Humanity cannot, at present, sufficiently appreciate what Louis A. Sayre
has done in its behalf. It is here that we realize the hidden wisdom of
the Mosaic law and the truth of the assertion of the late Dr. Edward
Clarke, that, &ldquo;The instructors, the houses and schools of our
country&rsquo;s daughters, would profit by reading the old Levitical
law. The race has not yet outgrown the physiology of Moses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These irritations from the preputial irritability are not always so slow
moving as to span over either months or years in their fell work.
Instances of their sudden action have been sufficiently recorded as to
warrant them as being classed as causative agents in acute affections
that instantly threaten life. In the London <i>Lancet</i> of May 16, 1846,
there is a record of a very peculiar case reported to the London Medical
Society by Dr. Golding Bird: &ldquo;The case was that of a child seven
or eight weeks old only, an out-patient of Guy&rsquo;s Hospital. The
child had become almost lifeless immediately after nursing, and to all
appearances looked as if under the influence of some narcotic. It had
not, however, had anything of the kind given to it, nor had it sustained
a fall, nor was the head so large as to lead to suspicion of congenital
hydrocephalus. On inquiring if the child passed water, the answer led to
an examination of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
prepuce, which was found to be elongated, and had an aperture only of
the size of a pin-hole, like a puncture in the intestines. The urine was
dribbling out; it was evident that the child had never completely
emptied its bladder. Mr. Hilton slit up the prepuce, and all the
symptoms were immediately relieved and soon entirely removed.&rdquo; Dr.
Bird referred to a case which he had related to the Society some years
before, which was reported in the <i>Lancet</i> at the time, of a child who
fell a victim to a malformation of this kind, and after death the
bladder and ureter were found like those of a man who had long suffered
from stricture. Mr. Hilton has seen many cases similar to the one
mentioned by Dr. Bird. The greatest benefit resulted from slitting up
the prepuce. In this case the benefit was very remarkable, a partial
paralysis of the left side, under which the little patient labored,
being quite removed in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>In this case the difficulty was evidently both the result of mechanical
pressure and reflex irritation. A somewhat similar case as to its
results is given by Dr. Sayre, to whom the case was reported by Dr. A.
R. Mott, Jr., of Randall&rsquo;s Island, in January of 1880: &ldquo;John
English, aged 46, native of England, widower, clerk; admitted to
workhouse hospital. Patient had been at work for a week as a prisoner;
on the 23d of December was noticed to be restless and uneasy, and
finally, in the evening, he fell from his bunk in a fit. During the next
forty-eight hours he had several convulsions, and during the intervals
lay in a semi-comatose condition, showing no consciousness except to
stir a limb when pinched. Pulse, 120; temperature, 101-1/2&deg;;
respiration, 18. Swallowed nothing, and passed f&aelig;ces in bed. Continued
in this condition until December 25th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
(temperature having fallen to 100&deg;), when a string was discovered
passed twice around the penis behind corona and tied, the long prepuce
serving to conceal it from observation. While not sufficiently tight to
occlude the urethral canal, still a firm, indurated band remained after
the string was cut, and did not disappear for four or five days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Within one hour after the removal of the string the man sat up
and asked for milk, and from this time remained perfectly well (was
under observation for three months). He declared that he remembered
nothing that had taken place during the past three days; had never had
fits, denied venereal diseases, was moderately addicted to drink, but
had led a &lsquo;virtuous life since the death of his wife, two years
before.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following case in the practice of Dr. F. J. Wirthington, of
Livermore, Pa., was also reported to Dr. Sayre: &ldquo;When the child
was born, he was considered the biggest and finest boy that had been
born in the community for a long time, until, when he was about two and
a-half years old, and being sick, a doctor was called in, who told them
that their child was paralyzed, the paralysis being in his lower
extremities, and who treated him with the usual nerve-tonic and with
electricity. Notwithstanding all this, the boy went steadily down, and
the paralysis continued until he was seen by Dr. Wirthington. The child
was then unable to walk; on examination, the prepuce was found to be
adherent almost all the way around the glans penis. Behind the corona
was a solid cake of sebaceous matter. The case was promptly operated
upon, and, although the previous attendant had not found any cause to
account for the paralysis, a rapid recovery took place, the boy being
able to walk even before the complete cicatrization of the wound, and
was soon the picture of health.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Dr. T. F. Leech, of Attica, Fountain County, Ind., reports a case of a
fourteen-month-old child, who had been the terror of all that part of
the town for over six months, as he cried constantly. Except when asleep
or nursed by his mother, he would lie perfectly still and squall, not
showing any disposition to sit up; nor did he like to be raised up. He
was very nervous, and would have times when his limbs would be rigid.
This state of things grew worse, until the child was accidentally seen
by Dr. Leech, who, on examination, found a contracted and adherent
prepuce, the child being at the time in a high fever and suffering great
nervous excitement. An operation by slitting and breaking up the
adhesion afforded immediate relief; the spinal irritation, partial
paralysis of the lower extremities, spasms during urination, and all
trouble disappeared as if by magic.</p>

<p>Prof. J. H. Pooley, of Columbus, Ohio, reported the case of a fine,
healthy boy who, up to three months before being seen professionally,
had always been well and in perfect health. His condition was found by
Professor Pooley to be one of localized chorea, manifesting itself in
constant convulsive movements of the head. They were nodding or
antero-posterior movements, alternating with lateral or shaking and
twisting motions; these movements had become almost constant during the
waking hours of the child. There was no distortion of the features nor
any choreic movements of the extremities; indeed, the whole affection
consisted in the nodding and shaking movements of the head referred to.
These were almost incessant, sometimes slow and almost rhythmical, then
for a minute or two rapid and irregular, seeming to fatigue the little
fellow, and accompanied by a fretful, whimpering cry. The child had been
subjected to a variety of treatment, but without any benefit or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
effect of any kind. Upon the most careful examination of the patient
and his history, Professor Pooley could not discover anything that
seemed to throw any light upon the case, except a condition of
well-marked phimosis. Acting upon this, the Professor immediately
circumcised the child, and from the very day of the operation the
spasmodic action began to diminish, and in two weeks he was entirely
well, without any other treatment of any kind.</p>

<p>Dr. W. R. McMahon, of Huntington, Indiana, has reported three cases of
epilepsy in children caused by congenital phimosis that were entirely
relieved by an operation without any subsequent return of the
difficulty. One of the cases was in a boy ten years old, with very firm
preputial adhesions and a high grade of inflammation of the parts.</p>

<p>Dr. J. D. Griffith, of Kansas City, Mo., operated on a case of phimosis
on a child nearly three years of age, who was afflicted with repeated
attacks of convulsions and paralysis of the hips and lower extremities;
the little fellow had as many as fifteen convulsions in a day; the
patient was greatly troubled with painful urination and priapism. On
examination at the operation, a firmly adherent prepuce and a large roll
of caseous matter was found just back of the corona. A complete recovery
followed the removal of these conditions.</p>

<p>The above cases are taken from the paper read before the Section of
Diseases of Children at the International Medical Congress of 1887, by
Dr. Sayre. It contains a number of additional cases of an analogous
character to the above, reported to him by physicians in different parts
of the country. They show the variety, extent, and far-reaching
character of the diseases induced by any preputial irritation. Dr. G. L.
Magruder, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of Washington, D. C., in the same paper, has a record of twenty-five
cases of various nervous disturbances which he had entirely relieved by
circumcision or dilatation, without any medication whatever. Dr.
Magruder, in concluding his report, in which he quotes the authority of
Brown-S&eacute;quard, Charcot, and Leyden, as having noticed serious
nervous disturbances resulting from reflex irritation due to affections
of the genito-urinary organs, observes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the foregoing, I think that we are justified in the
conclusion that phimosis and adherent prepuce give rise to varied
troubles of more or less gravity, manifesting themselves either in the
muscular, osseous, or nervous systems; and that the removal of these
abnormal conditions of the penis frequently affords marked relief, and,
at times, perfect and permanent cure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the discussion that followed the reading of Dr. Sayre&rsquo;s paper,
Dr. De Forest Willard, of Philadelphia, remarked that he had operated by
simply stripping back the prepuce and that he did not circumcise, but
that he looked upon the subsequent cleanliness of the parts as the
greatest safeguard, not only as against reflex irritation, but also
against masturbation. Retained filth and smegma are far more likely to
call a boy&rsquo;s attention to his penis by their unrecognized
irritative effects than washing can possibly do. His practice is in
accordance with the belief that young children can be relieved by the
simpler methods, such as dilatation; but he also observes that when a
child has reached eight or ten years of age, and has never been able to
expose the glans, contraction is almost certain to be present, and
circumcision must be performed. In adults there is rarely any escape
when the prepuce is tight.</p>

<p>Dr. I. N. Love, of St. Louis, said: &ldquo;It has been my <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
judgment and my practice for <ins class='corr'
title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;may&rsquo;.">many</ins> years, in these reflex irritations, to pursue
the radical course of circumcision. I believe thoroughly in the Mosaic
law, not only from a moral but also from a sanitary stand-point. All
genital irritation should be thoroughly removed. It is all very well to
instruct the mother or the nurse to keep the parts within the prepuce
clean, but they can not or will not do it. Complete and proper removal
of the covering to the glans takes away all the cause of disturbance.
Dr. Sayre takes a more pronounced position on this subject than the
majority of those who have discussed his paper. An improper performance
of a surgical procedure is no argument against the operation, but rather
against the operator. For the reasons I have given, I am in favor of the
radical application of the Mosaic rite of circumcision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. J. Lewis Smith, the president of the Section, believed in the evil
results of the reflex irritation due to abnormality of the prepuce. In
many instances the causative relation of the preputial disease to the
symptoms which it produces is not so apparent as it may be in others,
but after correct treatment of the prepuce they disappear. There was one
result of phimosis which, he observed, neither Professor Sayre nor those
who contributed to his paper noticed. The expulsive efforts accompanying
urination sometimes cause prolapsus of the rectum, and frequently
produce inguinal hernia. In a lecture before the Harveian Society
(<i>British Medical Journal</i>, February 28, 1880), Edmund Owen, Surgeon to
St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital and to the Hospital for Sick Children, says:
&ldquo;Perhaps the commonest cause of hernia in childhood is a small
preputial or urethral orifice, and next to that I would put the
smegma-hiding or adherent prepuce.&rdquo; Arthur Kemp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
(London <i>Lancet</i>, July 27, 1878), Senior House-Surgeon to the
Children&rsquo;s Hospital, says: &ldquo;Phimosis is a common occurrence,
and numerous ill effects can undoubtedly be attributed to it;&rdquo; and
he alludes to the observation of Mr. Bryant, as published in his book on
the &ldquo;Surgical Diseases of Children&rdquo;: &ldquo;In fifty
consecutive cases of congenital phimosis, thirty-one had hernia, five
had double inguinal hernia, and many had umbilical hernia besides. In no
one was the hernia congenital, its earliest occurrence being at three
weeks. Circumcision was performed in these cases, and all were much
benefited.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>During the session of the Ninth International Congress, where the above
paper was read and remarks made, which appear in the third volume of its
&ldquo;Transactions,&rdquo; another paper was also presented by Dr.
Saint-Germain, of Paris. The Doctor fully recognized the dangers from a
narrow or adherent prepuce, but did not think that more than one case in
three hundred really required circumcision; he believed in dilatation,
as employed by Nelaton, with the exception that, whereas Nelaton employs
three branches to his dilator, Saint-Germain preferred only a two-branch
dilator.</p>

<p>Dr. Lewis, the president of the Section, related a number of cases where
the use of uncleanly instruments had resulted disastrously. But, for
that matter, the same objection can be offered against dilatation, as a
filthy instrument is as liable to infect the patient as a knife. There
is no earthly excuse why a knife that has been used on a case of
diphtheritic croup should be used some hours afterward to circumcise a
child. As to the operation of dilatation practiced by Dr. Holgate, it
can really be said to answer the <i>immediate</i> demands, but how far its
utility is efficient as to <i>permanent</i> results<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Dr. Holgate has not given the profession any information.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>One of the most interesting and instructive papers that it was ever the
fortune of the writer to listen to, touching on the subject of reflex
nervous diseases or neuroses due to preputial adhesions, was one
prepared by Dr. M. F. Price, of Colton, California, and read at the
semi-annual meeting of the Southern California Medical Society, at its
Pasadena meeting in December, 1889. In the course of the paper he gives
a considerable number of examples, of which some extracts are herewith
given: One case was a boy aged seven, who for two years had had frequent
attacks of palpitation of the heart; when seen by Dr. Price the little
heart was laboring hard, beating at a furious rate (far beyond
counting), with a loud blowing or splashing sound, and the pulse at the
wrist a mere flutter. The breath was inspired in a series of jerks, the
face flushed and somewhat swollen. The chest-wall was visibly moved at
every thump of the heart. The doctor attended the child for a month
without the little patient making any appreciable improvement. Some time
during this period of observation the father happened to mention that
the boy sometimes complained of his penis hurting him at the time of an
erection. This led the doctor to examine the parts, when he found a long
prepuce, with a mucous membrane adherent to the glans, about a line
beyond the corona, the whole circumference of the organ. With the use of
cocaine and a blunt instrument the adhesions were removed, with an
immediate amelioration of all the reflex symptoms. The very next
paroxysm was lighter and less exhausting; the improvement was
continuous. The child soon went to school and had no further trouble;
but, in the doctor&rsquo;s opinion, the two years&rsquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
hard struggle have not been without its evil results on the
constitution and organism of the child.</p>

<p>The next case was born November 2, 1888; a large, healthy boy at birth.
By June of the following year the child was afflicted with what the
mother called &ldquo;jerky spells;&rdquo; up to this time the boy seemed
listless, did not care to sit up, and seemed from some cause to be in
more or less pain, with his eyes turned to the left. The parents dreaded
that the child, their only one, would turn out idiotic. The spasmodic
spells alluded to were of a tetanic nature, the body being thrown
backward; his head and eyes continued to be turned to the left, and
nothing could attract the child&rsquo;s attention. The boy cried night
and day, but he was in good flesh, had all the teeth he should have,
bowels were regular, and the appetite good. Whatever the doctor did in
the medical way seemed to be of no avail. One day, however, he thought
of examining the prepuce, thinking, perhaps, that it might be contracted
and that the convulsive movements might be reflexes from the parts. On
examination the prepuce was found elongated and distended, with a very
minute opening; this was dilated with difficulty, when the inner fold
was found adhering almost the whole extent of the glans; the dilatation
and breaking down of these adhesions was slowly persevered in, until
sufficient dilatation was obtained and the glans was freed. From the
very first operation the convulsions commenced to diminish, both in
force and frequency, and a constant and rapid improvement of the child
took place. Six months afterward the boy was perfectly normal, stood by
himself, played with play-things, and was an interested member of the
family circle.</p>

<p>Case No. 3 was a repetition of Case No. 2, except <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
that, with the experience of the latter case, the doctor wasted no time
with medication, but proceeded at once to examine the prepuce, which was
found to be very long, and with a pin-hole opening. The dilatation of
this and the breaking up of the adhesions gave immediate relief. During
the course of the paper he quoted the case related by
Brown-S&eacute;quard, and recorded in the New York <i>Medical Record</i>,
vol. xxxiv, p. 314, where he &ldquo;related a very interesting case that
presented all the rational signs of advanced cerebral disease, a case
that he considered quite hopeless, that was relieved by an operation for
phimosis and the treatment of an inflammatory condition of the glans
penis.&rdquo; To use Brown-S&eacute;quard&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;So
rapid was the recovery that within six weeks from the day of the
operation he presented himself at my office perfectly well in every
respect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the early part of this book, in speaking of female circumcision, it
was mentioned that when the medical part of the volume should be reached
some medical reasons for its necessity would be given. Dr. Price, in his
paper, gives some information on this subject, which is of the greatest
interest. In the course of the paper he says as follows: &ldquo;Nor do I
think these reflex neuroses from adherent prepuce wholly confined to the
male sex. The preputium-clitoridis may be adherent and produce in the
female similar reflexes. During the session of the American Medical
Association, held in Chicago in 1874, I think, I attended one afternoon
a clinical lecture by Dr. Sayre. A little girl, fourteen years of age,
but about the size of a seven-year-old child, was brought in, who had
never walked nor spoken, but with quite an intelligent countenance, who
was in constant motion, and who presented very many nervous <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
symptoms. Dr. Sayre examined her, and found the prepuce adherent the
whole extent of the clitoris. He gave it as his opinion that here was
the primary and sole cause of the symptoms, and that appropriate
treatment shortly after birth would have prevented all the serious
consequences so painfully apparent, and which was then too late to
remedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I once had occasion to pass a catheter into the bladder of a lady
who presented an innumerable train of nervous symptoms, often bordering
on insanity, but was unable to do so without exposing the parts.
Although the meatus could be distinctly felt, the catheter would not
enter. On exposure to view, an opening was seen in the clitoris, which
was firmly bound down by preputial adhesions near the extremity of the
organ. Entering the catheter at this point, it readily passed through
the clitoris, then down through a passage under the mucous membrane to
the natural site of the meatus, on into the urethra, and through into
the bladder. In the light of recent experience, my opinion now is, that
here was the cause of all the nervous symptoms in this case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The relative disposition in regard to the irritability of the external
sexual organs as existing in the female, when contrasted with the male,
is, for some reason, not sufficiently considered or understood. The idea
of masturbation or of irritation from the genitals ending in reflex
neuroses is always, as a rule, associated with the male, and that it has
not been more associated with the female has deprived her of the same
benefit that the prosecution of the study in this regard has been to the
male sex. Masturbation among the feeble-minded, which is so common,
must, of necessity, have for its determining cause a foundation of
morbid irritability of the sexual <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
organs. This is well known to be so among the males, whose hands seem
instinctively to be drawn to those parts. Dr. C. F. Taylor, of New York,
in an article on the &ldquo;Effect of Imperfect Hygiene of the Sexual
Function,&rdquo; published in the <i>American Journal of Obstetrics</i> for
January, 1882, gives us an account of his investigations in this regard,
with the following results: &ldquo;In an asylum for the feeble-minded of
both sexes, it was found that the habit was about equal in the two
sexes, there being only this difference: that the females began to
masturbate one or two years earlier than the males, and that the habit,
once established, was found to be more persistent than in the males. It
was, further, ascertained that the habit came naturally, without the aid
of precept or example to either sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may well be a question as to whether the feeble-mindedness be not a
reflex condition from this excessive morbid irritability of the sexual
organs. There is not much doubt but that, if one of the cases reported
by Dr. Price had not been circumcised, the expressionless, listless
infant would have grown, in time, into a masturbating, feeble-minded,
idiotic creature, as many others, so situated, have done before it. Now,
would it have been logical to have laid the morbid irritability of its
generative organs to its feeble-mindedness, when its feeble-mindedness
was fully demonstrated to have been wholly dependent on the sexual
irritation? From these premises we might take another step forward, and
ask whether, under a proper hygienic prophylaxis,&mdash;which would involve a
thorough inspection of the genitals of <i>all</i> children reported to be
either physically or mentally deficient,&mdash;such a course would not
greatly diminish the number of paralytics, feeble-minded, and generally
deficient of both sexes? If the results in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
private practice are any criterion, it is safe to assert that a strict
adherence to the Mosaic law for the males and to some of the African
customs for the females would most assuredly relieve all these cases
that might come under the caption of results of reflex neuroses. Twenty
years ago this subject was, to the body of the profession, a <i>terra
incognita</i> in regard to the male, and, as the female is similarly
subject to the same morbid influence, it is to be hoped that in the
present decade she will receive the same attention which the profession
is now beginning to pay to the male sex.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>In the foregoing parts of this chapter, examples of reflex neuroses have
been given to show the different effects that genital irritation will
produce. The cases given were chosen for the diversity of variety of
symptoms, and as cases representing the affection, without any other
complication. Many more could have been added, but they are unnecessary.
In the writer&rsquo;s practice there has been a number of cases in the
adult that have exemplified that this form of ailment is by no means
restricted to children, as has been shown in the case reported by Dr.
Mott to Dr. Sayre, in regard to the middle-aged man with a string about
his penis. One of these cases was that of a young man, six feet in
stature, broad-shouldered, and well built. He applied for relief for a
dyspepsia that affected his stomach and also his heart. The man had an
apparently feeble and irritable heart; cold, clammy skin; disturbed
digestion, and uneasy sleep; was constipated and flatulent. No treatment
seemed to make any impression upon his case. At last he began to
emaciate and look haggard. His mind was also becoming visibly weaker,
was attacked by dizziness, and on several occasions he fell in a fit.
With this condition he at last began to have frequent <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
nocturnal emissions. On account of the latter his genital organs were
examined, and the penis was found smaller than the average, with a long
and narrow prepuce. The glans could easily be uncovered, but the
tightness of the prepuce and its unyielding qualities made paraphimosis
a possibility; so that the young man, having once or twice had
considerable difficulty in returning the prepuce to its place, never
attempted its retraction again. There were no adhesions, but the inner
fold of the prepuce had been thickened by balanitis. Seeing the need of
circumcision <i>for the local benefit</i>, the operation was suggested with a
view of relieving the pressure on the glans, which was looked upon as
the probable cause, in his broken-down condition, of the advent of the
nocturnal emissions. He gladly submitted, and, to the surprise of both
physician and patient, <i>all</i> his troubles disappeared, and he at once
became a changed man. So impressed was he with the result, that, on his
return to his home, he examined his younger brother, and, finding him
with a like long, narrow prepuce, he immediately brought him in and had
him circumcised, as a prophylactic against his being subjected to the
risk of lost health as he himself had suffered.</p>

<p>Another case, a man of forty-five, also a farmer, was afflicted with
dyspepsia, palpitation of the heart, general debility, constipation,
constant headache, etc. He could not cut up an armful of wood without
bringing on palpitations and gaseous eructations, or being upset for the
day; and after having connection with his wife he generally had a
terrific headache, lasting for two or three days;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
he could stand no protracted mental effort, even such as is required to
make an addition of a long line of figures, or the least business worry,
without the supervening <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
headache. All treatment against these conditions was useless; the colon
was kept empty, the diet was changed; pepsin and bismuth, tonics,
frictions, Turkish baths, and all hygienic observances and moral
treatment were all of no avail. One day, on consulting the writer, he
complained of a pruritus at the head of the penis. On examination it was
found that he had a narrow, long prepuce, a congenitally-contracted
meatus, and was then suffering with a slight balanitis. He was very
careful to keep the parts clean, but, he informed me, that in spite of
all precautions, these attacks would come on. The mucous covering of the
inner fold of the prepuce and glans was so irritable that connection
often brought it about. The glans was small and elongated, with the
meatus red, and with lips &oelig;dematous and congested. To free him
from this tormenter, circumcision was advised. The party could not,
however, remain away from home for the time required for the operation;
so that a compromise operation was performed,&mdash;one that would not
keep him from business, and, at the same time, relieve the contracting
pressure on the glans. This was by Clouquet&rsquo;s operation and
bandaging back the prepuce over the penis, back of the corona,&mdash;an
operation that, in my hands, has often filled all the desired purpose.
The meatus was also incised. After the operation <i>all</i> of his troubles
disappeared, as they had done in the preceding case, and he was soon a
hearty and well man, able to chop wood, attend to business, and, in case
of need, do family duty for a Turkish harem without recurrence of his
old tormenting, dyspeptic palpitation or sick-headache.</p>

<p>The writer has resorted to circumcision in many cases to improve the
temper and disposition of children, with the best of results, and in one
case, in association with another physician, performed the operation on
a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
lunatic, whose lunacy ran to women and girls, with whom he would fall
desperately in love, without any encouragement or provocation, or even
acquaintance; finally reaching spells of such incoherence of action and
speech that confinement would be required. The peculiarity of his
hallucinations called attention to the genital organs. This man had
never masturbated, and was, when well, a compactly-built, active, and
intelligent man. By occupation he was a contractor, and a man of more
than usual executive ability besides. On examination it was found that
he was a subject of congenital phimosis, never having been able to
uncover the glans. He had been in the habit of washing out the preputial
cavity by the aid of a flat-nozzled syringe. The prepuce was long, but
not thick; nevertheless, it was inelastic and very firm. The examination
seemed to have a good mental effect upon the man, as it made him quite
rational for the moment. He entered into the idea that this condition
had some connection with his derangement very intelligently, even
suggesting many symptoms and attacks that he had suffered from childhood
up as probably gradual-stepping processes through which his present
condition had been reached. He cheerfully submitted to a thorough
circumcision, which had the effect of ameliorating his condition. He was
subsequently sent to an asylum, where, after a short time, he was
discharged well. Some years afterward, conscious of feeling a return of
the mental derangement, he voluntarily applied for admission to the same
institution and remained until better.</p>

<p>This case is very instructive. The patient readily connected his mental
trouble, by a retrospective view through a series of
gradually-increasing troubles, that originated in the preputial
condition, to the phimosed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
condition of that appendage, and he was certain that this prepuce had
been at the bottom of all the physical and mental trouble he had
experienced. The reflex nervous train of affections had undoubtedly
produced some localized lesion in the brain-structure. The natural
sound, healthy organism of that organ, and the bright, active nature of
his mind, however, prevented a total wreckage of the mental faculties.
It is safe to assume that, had he had the ordinary listless, unresisting
mind, disposed to brood, and easily cast down, he would, from the first
derangement, have become a hopeless and demented lunatic. The
circumcision could not undo all the mischief that had been accomplished,
some of which had certainly left a permanent taint, but the mildness of
his future attacks and the better exercise of his volition were the
undoubted results of the operation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>Dysuria, Enuresis, and Retention of Urine.</span></h2>

<p>Any dissertation on circumcision and its many uses, either prophylactic
or curative, would be incomplete without a reference to enuresis;
another reason for making a somewhat full reference to the subject would
be the undecided position that this morbid condition seems to occupy in
medical literature, as well as the meagre and unsatisfactory treatment
it has received by the majority of those who have mentioned it. It is
anomalous, to say the least, to find, in general or special literature,
enuresis mentioned as a diseased condition peculiar from babyhood to
puberty; to find it fully described and to have it stated that it is a
widely-prevalent distemper, affecting both sexes alike; to know that it
is an annoying, intractable, persistent condition, wearing to the child
in every sense, subjecting it to a demoralizing mortification as well as
to unmerited scoldings, humiliations, and punishments, and that its
habit, in badly-ventilated quarters, will breed other diseases,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
as well as that its continued action tends to the development of
onanism, with its long and widely-ramifying trains of physical and
social ills; and to find works especially devoted to children&rsquo;s
diseases silent on the subject. Knowing all these things, and also that
Ultzmann, Lallemand, and others who have treated this affection, mention
it as a children&rsquo;s disease, it is unaccountable to reason out why
most of our text-books and treatises on children&rsquo;s diseases should
be so remarkably and unreasonably silent. It certainly cannot be laid to
its lacking in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
study material, as the author of &ldquo;Quain&rsquo;s Dictionary of
Medicine&rdquo; says: &ldquo;It is one relative to which much might be
written without exhausting the subject, the pathology of which has wide
and manifold relations.... There appears to be something analogous
between this condition and that which determines in after life the
seminal emissions under similar circumstances.&rdquo; Our American works
are notably deficient in this regard; although Stewart, of New York, in
his &ldquo;Diseases of Children,&rdquo; published over fifty years ago,
devotes a chapter to dysuria and one to retention of urine, treating the
subject quite fully, even down to the description of preputial calculi;
he, however, failed to notice that the irritation of preputial
constriction or adhesions will produce both conditions, and, following
many of the authors of the time, as has been done since, he adopted the
urino-digestion theory of acid and irritating urine, due to faulty
digestion, of Prout and Magendie, who looked to regulating the digestion
of the child, or the mother who nursed it, as the only method of cure;
the lithic-acid diathesis being, in their opinion, the main thing to be
guarded from.</p>

<p>Other works that mention these conditions are equally on the wide sea of
speculation, as they all, more or less, look upon the treatment that
they advise as indefinite and unsatisfactory, showing an equal want of
sound anchorage-grounds for their etiological reasonings. Dillnberger,
of Vienna, in his hand-book of children&rsquo;s diseases, mentions
enuresis, but has nothing better to offer for its relief than that
advised by Bednar, who followed a systematically-timed period of
awakening, gradually lengthened out, from the time of putting the child
to bed. In addition, he advises internal medication, and, like Ultzmann,
he recognizes the possibility <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of a local cause in little girls, in whom he advises the local
application of nitrate of silver. Edward Ellis mentions dysuria, and a
long prepuce is noticed among its numerous causes. The works that give
the subject the most intelligent treatment (the word
&ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; is here used advisedly, and is in reference to
the results obtained) are those of West, of London, and Henoch, of
Berlin. West, in his &ldquo;Diseases of Children,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;In
the child, however, we sometimes find the symptoms produced by
difficulty in making water owing to the length of the prepuce and the
extreme narrowness of its orifice, which may even be scarcely large
enough to admit the head of a pin. This congenital phimosis is, I may
add, not an infrequent occasion of incontinence of urine in children,
and is also an exciting cause of the habit of masturbation, owing to the
discomfort and irritation which it constantly keeps up. In every case,
therefore, where any difficulty attends the passing or the retention of
the urine, or where the practice of masturbation is suspected, the penis
ought to be examined, and circumcision performed if the preputial
opening is too small. This little operation, too, ought never to be
delayed, since, if put off, adhesions are very likely to form between
the glans and the foreskin, which render the necessary surgical
proceeding less easy and more severe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Lectures on Diseases of Children,&rdquo; Henoch, of
Berlin, says: &ldquo;I need scarcely add that an examination of the
external genitals should never be omitted in any case of dysuria during
childhood. You will not infrequently discover a phimosis which
interferes more or less with the discharge of urine and retains portions
of the latter behind the foreskin, where it may decompose and give rise
to an inflammatory condition of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
prepuce, with painful dysuria.... This is also true of the occasional
adhesion of the labia minora in little girls, like the similar adhesion
of the foreskin in boys. It is almost constant in the first period of
life, but sometimes persists to the end of the first year; can usually
be torn by the handle of the scalpel, and rarely requires an incision.
In a few cases this adhesion appeared to me to be the cause of the
dysuria, which disappeared after the separation of the labia from one
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henoch, however, does not seem to have grasped the full relation that
the natural phimosis of young children bears to dysuria, as he here
follows the prevailing opinion, that where by dint, push, hauling, and
hard work the prepuce can be pushed back phimosis does not exist, as
well as the general apathy to the fact that a prepuce can exert a very
injurious influence by its pressure, even when not adherent and very
retractable; such a prepuce is often attended by balanitis and
posthitis, with an accompanying difficult, frequent, and painful
urination. In a case which will be related farther on, in the discussion
of the systemic effects of a long, contracted prepuce, as it induces
diseased action by continuity of tissues, there is an account of a death
of a two-year-old child which we can assume to have had its original
starting-point in a condition of phimosis. Henoch, however, rather
attributes the death in that case to what may well be considered the
result of a cause, leaving the original cause more to appear as a final
accessory condition.</p>

<p>My reasons for this view of the subject are simply owing to the fact
that I do not believe that a child can long be afflicted with the
<i>ischuria phimosica</i> of Sauvages without having the urinary organs
beyond more or less seriously affected from the mere retention alone,
irrespective <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of any reflex irritation from the pressure on the glans or of any from
the irritation of the peripheral nerves; the dilatation of the adjacent
cavities or channels and the deposit of calcareous matter being
facilitated by the retention of urine and its naturally altered
condition owing to that retention. So that dysuria in young children,
beginning in a slightly phimosed condition, or in the irritability of
the glans and meatus, due to its preputial covering, it is safe to
assume, may produce a train of symptoms ending in permanently-injured
health, or even death. The irritating urine of a slight access of fever
may, by its passage over the irritable mucous lining of the prepuce, be
the initial starting-point of a serious or fatally-ending disease. In
all of these, it must be admitted, the presence of the prepuce is either
actively or passively the cause of the most serious disease processes
that may follow.</p>

<p>Ultzmann, of Vienna, in his work on the &ldquo;Neuroses of the
Genito-Urinary Organs,&rdquo; gives the subject of enuresis considerable
attention. It is not a work on diseases of children, but it,
nevertheless, goes into the subject as if it were, and furnishes the
profession with considerable information. He defines enuresis to be the
passage of urine of a normal quality in a child who, with the exception
of this involuntary urination, is healthy. In the first periods of life,
a slight vesical or intestinal expulsive effort is sufficient to
overcome the guarding sphincter muscles at their outlet; the child first
obtains a voluntary control of the rectal sphincter; and, generally,
with the second year it gains control of the vesical. Those who pass
their second year without obtaining this control, but in whom the organs
and urine are normal, may be said to be afflicted with enuresis. He
divides enuresis into three varieties; that involuntary <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
urination which takes place at night during sleep he terms the
<i>nocturnal</i>; that which takes place while climbing, laughing, coughing,
or in the course of any violent muscular exercise is the <i>diurnal</i>; and
that wherein the involuntary evacuation takes place day and night alike
he terms as the <i>continued</i>. This last is again subdivided into the
continuous and periodical. As a cause, he cites an&aelig;mia, scrofula,
rachitis; but adds that physical debility is not necessary for its
presence, as well-developed, vigorous, puffy children are as liable to
be affected as thin and scrawny ones; while not all scrofulous or
rachitic children are so affected, only a small portion being enuretic.
Sex has no influence on the liability that tends to being attacked, the
proportion between the sexes being about equal. As to age, he finds the
greatest proportion to be between three and ten years, but he has often
treated those of either sex even at the age of fourteen and up to
seventeen years. It is absolutely necessary to examine the external
genitals and the urine of those affected by this disease, as
phlegmasi&aelig; of the vagina, of the vestibule or urethra in girls, or
the practice of onanism, or lithiasis, cystitis, or pyelitis may be the
cause of the disease. Girls are apt to be found affected with polypoid
excrescences at the meatus, which when removed will cause the enuresis
to disappear.</p>

<p>From the above it will be observed that Ultzmann has paid much attention
to these neuroses; but it will also be remarked that neither the
balanitis, collection of infantile smegma, preputial adhesions nor
irritations are taken into any account as possible factors of either
dysuria or enuresis; he has followed more or less an electrical form of
treatment for genito-urinary neuroses, the rectal rheophore being one of
his favorite modes of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
treating enuresis; in his etiological views of these disturbances he
has adhered more or less to the views of Trousseau, Bretonneau, and
Dessault, who looked upon a debilitated or anomalous condition of the
vesical neck as the cause of the majority of neuroses in that region.</p>

<p>It may be asked why these celebrated and observing physicians have
neglected the preputial condition, if, as it is claimed, it is, in
itself, so important and sure a factor of the derangements at the
vesical neck? To answer this, or to explain any marked discrepancy that
may occur in medicine between minds equally as acute and observing, it
is but necessary to observe that there is, in medicine, to a certain
extent, a like rule of inheritance, education, with fashion or custom of
habit of thought and practice, as we find in religion. Canon Kingsley
and Froude are equally as acute and discerning as the late Cardinal
Newman, but that did not necessitate their following that prelate into
the foremost ranks of the Catholic Church; and Pere Hyacynthe was
equally as intelligent as Cardinal Newman, but that did not prevent him
from leaving the fold into which the Cardinal had entered from out of
the Reformed Church. Some are born Catholics or Protestants, and are so
with vehemence; others are born in these religions, but are only
lukewarm in their doctrinal observance; while others reason and jump the
traces in either direction. The followers of the destructive theories of
Bronssais could not see the errors of their ways, and neither could they
be made to see the merits of a less interfering form of medical
practice. Trousseau was himself at one time tainted with Bronssaisism,
but, like Paul of Tarsus, he was made to see the error of his way, as he
relates, through a case of gout that he nearly laid out in trying to lay
out the disease antiphlogistically.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
I do not assume that preputial irritation is at the bottom of <i>all</i>
cases of dysuria or enuresis, any more than it would be rational to deny
that cases of circumcision performed in some cases of diabetic enuresis
have proved fatal as a result of the operative interference; but it is
safe to assume that, in the great number of cases in whom some
irritating conditions were found and removed, the enuresis or dysuria
was due to such preputial irritation. It is also logical to assume, with
West and Henoch, that the organ should in all cases be examined, and its
condition rendered as harmless as possible. That the condition of
preputial irritation has not been fully recognized by all parties as a
cause of enuresis does not do away with the fact that it does exist, any
more than the refusal of the prelates and doctors of Salamanca to listen
to Columbus did away with the fact of the existence of the American
continents.</p>

<p>A. L. Ranney, in his &ldquo;Lectures on Nervous Diseases,&rdquo; pages
174, 175, speaks of enuresis in children as being a reflex cachexia,
&ldquo;excessive stimulation of the centripetal nerves connected with
the so-called &lsquo;vesical centres&rsquo; of the spinal
cord,&rdquo;&mdash;a condition which may be produced by either worms in the
intestines or by preputial irritation. Ranney advises a careful
exploration of the urethra and rectum in these cases, and the
elimination of all local causes of the conditions.</p>

<p>Probably the most remarkable case of the immediate continuous effects
resulting from phimosis is the one recorded by Vidal, in the fifth
volume of the third edition of his &ldquo;Surgery.&rdquo; This was a
young man with a congenital phimosis, having but a very small aperture;
on an operation to relieve the phimosis there was a gush of water, but
this only fell at the feet of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
patient, without being ejected at any distance; the urethra was found
to have undergone precisely the same dilatation back of this preputial
orifice that it usually undergoes back of a stricture; the whole urethra
from the meatus backward was found to have exceeded the calibre of that
of the vesical neck; the bladder was greatly dilated.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>General Systemic Diseases Induced by the Prepuce.</span></h2>

<p>Aside from all the local affections or reflex neuroses, either mental or
physical, that a prepuce may induce, there are an innumerable train of
diseases that may originate in this one cause that at first sight would
seem to have no connecting-link with any preputial condition.</p>

<p>It has already been suggested that the prepuce does not at all ages bear
the same analogous relation to man. In childhood, especially during our
earliest years, it is out of all proportion in size when compared to the
rest of the organ, or to any use it may have placed to its credit. Man
does not, then, certainly need that refinement of nervous sensitiveness
in the corona that is useful in after life in inducing the flow or
ejaculation of the seminal fluid; neither is there at that age much of a
corona to protect. In middle life, or what might be called the
procreative period of man, when the corona would seem to require all its
excitability or sensitiveness, seems to be the very season in life when
the glans is most apt to remain uncovered; so that nature and this
hypothetical idea of the use of the prepuce are evidently at variance.
So we go through childhood with this long funnel-shaped appendage into
manhood, when the increasing size of the body of the penis restores a
sort of equilibrium between the size and bulk of the organ and its
integumentary covering. At this period, as we have seen, although it
does not, from the equilibrium restored, and the more or less use to
which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
it is subjected, induce any great immediate or uncomplicated troubles,
it nevertheless endangers the existence of the penis through the
accidental course of some putrid or continued fever, or it subjects man
to the manifold dangers of venereal or tubercular infections.</p>

<p>In advanced age, owing to the diminution in size of the organ, the
prepuce resumes the proportionate bulky dimensions of childhood, and as
the organ recedes and becomes more and more diminutive, the prepuce
again, like in childhood, begins to tend to phimosis; the urine of the
aged is also more irritating and prone to decomposition or putrefaction,
and the constant state of moisture that the preputial canal of the aged
is necessarily kept in, either by frequent urination or the incomplete
emptying of the urethra that is peculiar to old age, and which results
in more or less dribbling, is a powerful factor in inducing the many
attacks of posthitis and balanitis, as well as those attacks of
excoriation and eczema which are so annoying to the aged. I have often
seen such cases happening to men past fifty, who, being widowers, and
never having had anything of the kind, as well as being in the most
complete ignorance of the nature of the disease, have, from delicacy and
fear that the disease might induce some suspicions as to their conduct
in the minds of those whose good opinions they value above all else,
gone on suffering untold miseries, especially if the urine were in the
least diabetic.</p>

<p>One such case that fell under my observation not only produced such
misery as to entail a loss of rest and of appetite, but even induced
such a disturbance of assimilation and nutrition that the resulting
hypochondriacal condition that developed from these enervating causes
ran the patient into a low condition, ending in complete prostration of
all vital powers and death, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
without the intervention of any other disease. The subject was a timid,
retiring man of about fifty-five years, and this was the first and only
time that the prepuce had ever caused him any annoyance,&mdash;a
circumstance which greatly preyed upon his mind, as he could not
disconnect it with the idea that it must be suspected as venereal,
although he had always led a most continent life since the death of his
wife. This is, of course, an extreme case; but as it is a result
beginning in a certain condition, be it an extreme, erratic, or
infrequent occurrence, it is, nevertheless, an example of what may
happen in advanced life, even where the prepuce has never before been a
source of the least disturbance or annoyance. Persons who, with the
increase of years, are also liable to an increase of adipose tissue, are
more subject to this dwindling down of the penis and consequent
elongation of the prepuce, with all the attendant annoyances, than thin
or spare people.</p>

<p>In this irritation that the prepuce is liable to cause, we have not only
to encounter the dangers that its thickenings or indurations may bring
on in their train, in the shape of cancer, gangrene, or hypertrophies,
but other and no less serious results are liable to follow a herpetic
attack, or in consequence of an attack of balanitis or posthitis. The
dysuria attending any of these conditions may be the initial move for
such a serious complication that life may be brought to a sudden end,
even in infancy, to say nothing of the ease with which life is taken off
in after years and in old age; with debilitated and imperfect kidney
action, it takes very little to hustle us off from life&rsquo;s
foot-bridge.</p>

<p>A case as occurring in Henoch&rsquo;s clinic, already mentioned or
referred to in a previous chapter, shows what a simple phimosis is
capable of inducing. In the history <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of the case the phimosis and the resulting retention in the preputial
cavity no doubt were the causes of the calculus found there; and the
succeeding calculi and abnormal condition of the urinary organs, we can
safely assume, were a subsequent creation to that in the prepuce. The
case is taken from Henoch&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lectures on Diseases of
Children,&rdquo; Wood Library edition, page 256, and is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A. L., aged two, admitted November 28, 1877. Quite well
nourished, but pale. Complete retention of urine for two days; slight
redness and marked &oelig;dema of penis, scrotum, and perineum. The
foreskin cannot be retracted, on account of phimosis. Abdomen distended,
hard, and sensitive, the dilated bladder extending a few fingers&rsquo;
breadth above the symphysis. In order to introduce the catheter, it was
first necessary to operate upon the phimosis, during which a calculus,
which completely occluded the meatus, was removed. The catheter, when
introduced into the bladder, removed a quantity of cloudy urine. The
&oelig;dema, rapidly disappeared under applications of lead-wash, but on
November 29th vomiting and diarrh&oelig;a occurred during the night, with
rapid collapse; December 1st, death. Autopsy: In the bladder, a
sulphur-yellow stone, as large as a hen&rsquo;s egg, completely filling
the organ; similar calculi, from the size of a pea to that of a bean, in
the pelvis of the left kidney; right kidney normal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the above case, the &oelig;dema of the penis, scrotum, and perineum was
as much a result of the distension of the bladder by the retained urine
interfering with the return circulation from the &oelig;dematous parts as
the different appearances of diseased conditions were a result of the
primary phimosis; yet this case, if seen during its early infancy, when
probably the contraction of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
preputial orifice was as yet not so well marked, would have been
pronounced one in which it would be needless and barbarous to perform
circumcision upon. We would most assuredly have to wander aimlessly and
unprofitably in the region of speculation to build up the etiology of
the above-related case and reach the culmination there found, unless we
accept the one that it was all, from first to last, the result of the
phimosis.</p>

<p>Jonah, pitched overboard at sea to appease the tempest and swallowed by
the whale, became convinced finally that he had better return to Nineveh
to preach reform; while Pharaoh would not let the children of Israel
depart even after Moses had so frightened him&mdash;as it is related in the
rabbinical traditions compiled by the Rev. T. Baring-Gould, M.A.&mdash;that
the royal bowels were completely relaxed at the sight of the snakes
turned loose about the royal throne,&mdash;a circumstance which nearly lost
him his claim to divinity, which was based on the fact that his bowels
moved only once a week, as in this case they not only moved out of time
and in the most unkingly manner, so that the noble king hid underneath
the throne, but before even Pharaoh could disengage himself from the
royal robes, which event could hardly have raised him in the estimation
of the gentlemen eunuchs of the bed-chamber. Those who unwound the mummy
of Pharaoh tell us that he had the appearance of a self-willed,
despotic, but intelligent, old gentleman; but the above rabbinical
relation, from Baring-Gould&rsquo;s &ldquo;Legends of the Patriarchs and
Prophets,&rdquo; seems to have had no convincing effect on Pharaoh; so
we must not be surprised if even a case like the one from Henoch&rsquo;s
clinic would, with many, carry no conviction.</p>

<p>In the second volume of Otis on &ldquo;Genito-Urinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Diseases,&rdquo; of the Birmingham edition, at page 380, there is an
interesting account of a physician who, in youth, was troubled with an
annoying prepuce, which, from frequent attacks of balanitis, had finally
become more or less adherent to the glans penis; up to the age of
nineteen he had been unable to completely uncover the glans. By six
months of hard and persistent labor he had finally broken up these
adhesions. At the age of twenty-two he married, and he then ruptured the
frenum, which bled profusely and left him sore for some days. Then for
twenty-seven years he had no further trouble, but at the end of that
time he began to experience what he believed were attacks of dumb ague,
and the scrotum began to swell and felt sore on firm pressure. Heavy,
aching pains then followed. This condition of things lasted for over
five years, varied by the appearance of carbuncles on the nose and
elsewhere, to relieve the monotony of the thing. From this time on,
abscesses began to form in the scrotum and into the integument of the
penis, burrowing forward into the prepuce, which was much swollen and
painful. A gangrenous opening effected itself in the dorsal surface,
which relieved him somewhat. The patient was finally examined by Dr.
Otis, who found a badly strictured urethra, the strictures beginning at
the meatus, and at intervals extended down as far as two and
three-fourths inches. The case had no venereal history, the patient
never having had any disease or anything of the kind. The strictures
were plainly the result of the balano-posthitic attacks as much as they
were the cause of the degeneration of the mucous membrane in the lower
urethra, that allowed of the infiltration of urine into the tissues,
which caused all the systemic disturbances, abscesses, misery, and agony
of the patient, depriving him of comfort, sleep, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
or ability for labor, and which sent him here and there in search of
health and relief.</p>

<p>It would seem really as if a prepuce was a dangerous appendage at any
time, and life-insurance companies should class the wearer of a prepuce
under the head of hazardous risks, for a circumcised laborer in a
powder-mill or a circumcised <ins class='corr'
title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;brakemen&rsquo;.">brakeman</ins> or locomotive engineer runs actually
less risk than an uncircumcised tailor or watchmaker. They recognize the
danger that lurks in a stricture, but what a prepuce can and does do,
they entirely ignore. I have not had any opportunities for comparison,
but it would be interesting to know, from the statistics of some of
these companies, how much more the Hebrew is, as a premium-payer, of
value to the company than his uncircumcised brother. Were they to offer
some inducement, in the shape of lower rates, to the circumcised, as
they should do, they would not only benefit the companies by insuring a
longer number of years, on which the insured would pay premiums, but
they would be instrumental in decreasing the death-rate and extending
longevity.</p>

<p>I have seen so many cases of stricture whose origin could be traced to
balanitis that it can almost with confidence be assumed that, wherever
there is a long prepuce with a red and inflamed meatus in a child, that
unfortunate child will be a victim of fossal strictures when arrived to
manhood, and that, moreover, he will be a surer victim to the reflex
neuroses which so often accompany strictures, and which have been so
ably described by Otis, than the victim of uncomplicated strictures
acquired in the worship of Venus. There is no end to the misery that
these poor fellows have to suffer, besides the habitual hypochondriacal
condition into which the accompanying physical depression, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
throws them; it unfits them for business, any undertaking, or even for
social enjoyment or entertainment; they keep themselves and their
families in continued hot water. These subjects are, also, more prone to
gouty and rheumatic affections, asthma, and other neuroses.</p>

<p>Among the many cases of nervous disorders simulating other diseases that
I have seen relieved were two Jewish lads with an imperfection of the
meatus. They were two brothers, and from the history of the cases, and
that given me by the mother of the lads in regard to the father, the
malformation must have been hereditary and congenital. It consisted of a
partial occlusion of the meatus by a false membrane, which divided the
meatus in two, horizontally, but which was closed at the posterior end
of the lower passage, which readily admitted a probe from the front as
far as the occlusion, about a third of an inch to the rear. The
restoration, or rather the making the anterior urethra and meatus to
their normal condition, relieved both boys of asthma, under which they
had labored for years.</p>

<p>The many cases simulating the general disturbances that accompany many
kidney disorders, that are simply the result, in their primary causes,
of preputial irritation and the disturbances to the kidney function due
to the same cause, have long induced me to look upon the prepuce as a
great and avoidable factor to some of the many forms of kidney diseases,
prostatic enlargements, vesical diseases, and many other diseases of the
urinary organs, which we know full well can result from strictures, as
the latter need not always act in a purely mechanical mode to do its
full extent of mischief.</p>

<p>One result of these preputial irritations not generally or particularly
mentioned in any of our text-books&mdash;a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
condition far-reaching as regards its own results, and more annoying
and serious than it appears at first sight&mdash;usually begins with a
reflex irritability of the anal sphincter muscle, or a rectal irritation
of the same order, which in time produces such organic change that an
hypertrophied and irritable, indurated, unyielding muscle is the result.
Agnew, of Philadelphia, describes the condition, but does not mention
this frequent cause under the name of sphincterismus; once this is
established, the train of resulting pathological or diseased conditions
that may follow are without end.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
This is no fancy sketch, nor will the student of the pedigree and origin
of diseases feel that the case is exaggerated or imaginative. These are
some of those cases that are always ailing, never well and really never
sick, but who are, nevertheless, gradually breaking down and finally die
of what is termed &ldquo;a complication of diseases,&rdquo; before
living out half their term of life.</p>

<p>How this happens is simple enough&mdash;the straining required to produce an
evacuation is out of all proportion with the character of the discharge;
such patients often complain of being constipated when the evacuations
are semi-fluid; this straining is followed by a dilatation and
consequent loss of power of the rectum, which becomes pouched and its
mucous membrane thickened; the whole intestinal tract sympathizes and
digestion is interfered with, and the forcible expulsive efforts affect
all the abdominal and thoracic organs in a more or less degree, laying
the foundation for serious organic diseases. Now, this condition, which
may be said to be no more than one of obstinate constipation, is a far
more reaching condition and a far more injurious state than can be
imagined at a first glance. Constipation is not, as a rule, always
accompanied by the indigestion, either <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
stomachic or intestinal, that goes with this condition; the contents of
the intestines in simple constipation may simply lack fluidity without
undergoing putrefactive fermentation, but in this condition the
undigested and retained intestinal contents do undergo that change,
resulting in the generation of material whose re-absorption produces a
toxic condition of the blood, from whence begins a series of serious
organic changes in the blood, and from this in the organs.</p>

<p>To the practical physician these changes are evident and their cause
just as plain, and it is just here where the laity lack the proper
education, and where they should understand that the intelligent
physician generalizes the disease and only individualizes the patient;
and it is this ignorance on the part of the laity that gives to
empiricism and quackery that advantage over them, as they look upon all
disease as a distinct individual ailment, that should have an equally
distinct and individual therapeutic agent to cope singly with. The laity
know very little of these things, and in their happy ignorance care
still less for the finer definitions of or of the clinical importance of
tox&aelig;mia, or the processes of abnormal conditions that lead up to such a
state, or the results that may follow when that condition is once
reached. To them, dyspepsia is an indigestion ascribable to the stomach,
and a sick-headache is ascribed to something wrong about the stomach or
liver.</p>

<p>The laity have never been called upon to answer the questioning of the
late Prof. Robley Dunglison: &ldquo;What do you mean, sir, by
biliousness? Do you mean, sir, that the liver does not secrete or
manufacture a sufficiency of bile, or not enough? Do you mean that the
bile-material is left in the blood, or too much poured in?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Do you mean that there is an excess in the alimentary canal, and a
deficiency elsewhere? Please, sir, explain what you really mean by the
term &lsquo;bilious!&rsquo;&rdquo; The Professor had a way about him
that at least made one stop and seriously inquire, before adopting any
random notion in regard to medicine. It is to be regretted that, in the
humdrum tread-mill work of many physicians, they even have to drop into
the commonplace way of treating dyspepsias and such ailments without any
further inquiry. A farmer knows better than to drive a dishing wheel, or
with merely having a nail clinched in the loose shoe of a valuable
horse; but he is fully satisfied to do so in a metaphorical sense, as
regards his own constitution, and the mere hint from his physician that
he had better lay up for repairs, or that there is something wrong about
him that will require investigation, and that there is an ulterior cause
to his feeling tired, headachy, or dyspeptic, or an allusion that there
is something systemic, as a cause, to his momentary attacks of
disordered vision or amaurosis, will generally make him look on the
doctor with mistrust.</p>

<p>The merchant, banker, and mechanic are not up to Professor von
Jaksch&rsquo;s ideas of tox&aelig;mia,&mdash;that tox&aelig;mia may be exogenous or
endogenous, or that the latter is further subdivided into three more
varieties,&mdash;and, what is worse, he cares still less. The above three
classes of humanity, when sick, simply would want to know if Professor
von Jaksch was good on dyspepsia, the measles, or typhoid fever. They
care very little that he divides endogenous or auto-tox&aelig;mia into that
produced by the normal products of tissue-interchange, abnormally
retained in the body, giving rise to ur&aelig;mia, tox&aelig;mia from acute
intestinal obstruction, etc., the above being the first division. The
second depends on the outcome of pathological <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
processes, which change the normal course of assimilation of food and
tissue-interchange; so that, instead of non-toxic, toxic matter is
formed. The second group he names noso-toxicoses, which he subdivides
into two principal divisions:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The carbohydrates, fats, or albuminous matter, which may be
decomposed abnormally and give rise to toxic products, <i>e.g.</i>, diabetic
intoxication, coma carcinomatosum.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A <i>contagium vivum</i> enters the body through the skin, or the
respiratory or digestive tract, and develops toxic agents in the tissues
on which it feeds, as in infectious diseases.</p>

<p>In the third group the toxic substance results from pathological
non-toxic products, which again produce a toxic agent, only under
certain conditions. This group he calls auto-toxicoses, and includes in
it poisonous substances, resulting from decomposition of the urine in
the bladder, under certain pathological conditions, and giving rise to
the condition called ammoni&aelig;mia. (<i>Medical News</i> of January 7, 1891;
from <i>Wiener klinische Wochenschrift</i> of December 25, 1890.)</p>

<p>As observed above, unfortunately the patients know nothing, nor can they
be made to understand these conditions, that are only reached through
labyrinthic pathological processes, and, what is still worse, this way
of looking at disease is incompatible with the idea of specific-disease
treatment, which to them looks more practicable and quick, and which is
also more to their liking. They cannot see any sense in such reasoning,
which to them is something eminently impracticable; neither can they see
a reasonable being in the doctor who practices on such, as they call
them, <i>theories</i>.</p>

<p>The practical physician, however, sees in Professor <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
von Jaksch&rsquo;s summary the turning-point of many a poor
fellow&rsquo;s career,&mdash;from one of comparative health into one of
organic disintegration, decay, and dissolution,&mdash;all the required
processes starting visibly from the very smallest of beginnings; any
obstruction in the urinary tract or intestinal canal being sufficient to
start any of the conditions which end in tox&aelig;mia; and, from a
careful observation running over several years, I do not think that I am
assuming too much in saying that a balanitis is often the tiny match
that lights the train that later explodes in an apoplectic attack or
sudden heart-failure due to tox&aelig;mia; the organic and vascular
systems being gradually undermined until, unannounced and unawares, the
ground gives way and the final catastrophe occurs,&mdash;unfortunately,
an occurrence or ending looked upon as unavoidable by the friends of the
victim. They cannot see any danger; the idea that diseases have the road
paved, not only for an easy entrance but an easy conquest, by the action
of these toxic agents on the tissues, is something that they cannot
grasp. These blood changes or blood conditions are things too intricate,
and the physician who understands them is, to them, a visionary and
unpractical man. These conditions are, however, neither new nor unknown,
and there is really no excuse for the ignorance exhibited in these
matters by the general public, as it is through the blood that this
mischief takes place. They can reason in their impotent way, that they
should drench themselves with &ldquo;blood tonics&rdquo; and all manner
of nauseous compounds to &ldquo;purify&rdquo; their blood, but the
simple, scientific truth is something beyond their understanding, as
well as something that they steel themselves against.</p>

<p>Sir Lionel Beale, in observing the immense importance <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
he attaches to blood composition and blood change in diseases of
various organs, truly remarks that &ldquo;blood change is the
starting-point, and may be looked upon as the cause, of what
follows,&rdquo; the other factor being the &ldquo;&lsquo;tendency&rsquo;
or inherent weakness or developmental defect of the organ which is the
subject of attack;&rdquo; to which he adds that he feels convinced that,
if only the blood could be kept right, thousands of serious cases of
illness would not occur; while the persistence of a healthy state of the
blood is the explanation of the fact that many get through a long life
without a single attack of illness, although they may have several weak
organs; and that an altered state of the blood, a departure from the
normal physiological condition, often explains the first step in many
forms of acute or chronic disease. Sir Lionel has been a pioneer in the
field of thought that looks for the cause of the disease, which, however
remote it may be, should not be overlooked as a really primary
affection. His extensive labor in the microscopic field has fully
convinced him that many of the pathological changes in the different
organs are due to what might be called some intercellular substance that
is deposited from the blood. (Beale: &ldquo;Urinary and Renal
Disorders.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Toxic elements in the blood affect the kidneys in a greater or less
degree, and there produce changes at first unnoticed,&mdash;at least, as long
as the kidney can perform its function,&mdash;but the day arrives when, as
described by Fothergill, blood depuration is imperfect, and we get many
diseases which are distinctly ur&aelig;mic in character, and ending in any of
the so-called kidney diseases, Bright&rsquo;s disease being one of the
most common. As observed by Fothergill, however, the kidney is not the
starting-point, the new departure only taking <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
place when the structural change on the kidney has reached that point
that it is no longer equal to its function&mdash;the &ldquo;renal
inadequacy&rdquo; of Sir Andrew Clarke. (J. Milner Fothergill, in the
<i>Satellite</i>, February, 1889.)</p>

<p>During the Bradshawe lecture, Dr. William Carter made the following
remarks: &ldquo;According to Bonchard, one-fifth of the total toxicity
of normal urines is due to the poisonous products re-absorbed into the
blood from the intestines, and resulting from putrefactive changes which
the residue of the food undergoes there.&rdquo; In the course of the
lecture, Dr. Carter fully explains that one of the benefits derived from
milk diet in Bright&rsquo;s disease is the small residuum deficient in
toxic properties, and lays great stress on the employment of intestinal
disinfectants or antiseptics that exercise their influence throughout
the whole tract, suggesting naphthalin as peculiarly efficacious,
thereby cutting off one source of blood contamination at its source.
Although these are recent developments in medicine, Bonchard mentions
that in the practice of M. Tapret cases treated on this principle did
well. (Braithwaite&rsquo;s <i>Retrospect</i>, January, 1889.)</p>

<p>Persons laboring under this toxic condition of the blood, with a
consequent deterioration in the texture and the physiological function
of the vital organs, are of that class that easily succumb to injuries
or serious sickness, and of that class to whom a surgical operation of
even medium magnitude is equal to a death-warrant.</p>

<p>The above conditions are an almost constant attendant on that condition
of the sphincter described by Agnew as sphincterismus, which also is
productive of h&aelig;morrhoids and fissure, and often of fistula. That
sphincterismus is caused in many cases by preputial <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
irritation is as evident as that the same affection, or
h&aelig;morrhoids or any other rectal or anal affection, will, in its
turn, produce vesical and urethral reflex actions, and primarily
functional and secondarily organic changes in those parts. Besides, the
great number of cases wherein the gradual and progressive march of each
pathological event could be traced with accuracy has convinced me of the
true cause of the difficulty being the result of reflex irritation.</p>

<p>Delafield, in his &ldquo;Studies in Pathological Anatomy,&rdquo; gives,
as the first form of pneumonia, that from heart disease; in the days of
Broussais this would have sounded absurd, but, to-day, some forms of
heart disease are known to be the regular sequences of some particular
form of kidney disease, just as some form of pneumonia attends an
affected heart and that some forms of pneumonia degenerate into
phthisis. When the blood change is an established fact, it is only a
question as to which is the weak organ, and the organism of the
individual will decide whether it will be a simple sick-headache or the
beginning of a pneumonia ending in phthisis.</p>

<p>I have purposely dwelt on this part of this subject, owing to the recent
origin and publication of many of the views connected with it; also on
account of the greater ease of making the subject plain by fully
discussing each step of the process; and if the views of Sir Lionel will
be recalled, that a toxic element in the blood is the starting-point,
and that an irritable or weakened organ invites destruction,&mdash;the
induction of serious and fatal kidney disorder by the transmitted
irritability and consequent injury to the kidney produced by preputial
irritation in the first instance, and the supplemental blood-poisoning
by intestinal absorption of septic <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
matter, which soon brings about Sir Andrew Clarke&rsquo;s
&ldquo;inadequacy of kidney,&rdquo;&mdash;all will be readily
understood. When this point is reached, a too hearty meal, exposure to
variable weather, or a little extra care or anxiety, are sufficient, as
determining causes, to bring life into danger.</p>

<p>As pointed out, many cases of Bright&rsquo;s disease or other renal
difficulty have their origin in this distant but visible source, and,
although malarial poisoning and a great number of other causes will
produce the same particular organic changes and diseases, this condition
must be admitted as one of the frequent causes. The influence of the
genito-urinary tract on the rest of the economy, and the importance of
the sympathy it excites, or how quickly, by its being irritated, some
apparently dormant pathological condition will be awakened to life and
activity, is not sufficiently appreciated. As observed by Hutchinson, a
patient who has once been the subject of intermittent fever is more
prone, on catheterization, to have a urethral chill and fever than one
who had never had the fever. (Hutchinson: &ldquo;Pedigree of
Diseases.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Ralfe observes, in his &ldquo;Kidney Diseases,&rdquo; that long-standing
disease of the genito-urinary passages must be reckoned as among the
chief etiological factors of chronic interstitial nephritis (page 227).
The condition of the kidneys in cases of strictures of long standing is
known not to be a reliable one, and any incentive to dysuria or to
retention, no matter how slight, is apt to lead, eventually&mdash;and that
even in very young subjects&mdash;to that toxic condition mentioned in a
former part of this chapter as one of von Jaksch&rsquo;s subdivisions of
tox&aelig;mia, the ammoni&aelig;mia of Frerichs; this condition being the fatal
ending of the case of the two-year-old child mentioned by Henoch, who
died after the relief of a retention due <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
to phimosis and calculi resulting from the phimotic occlusion. Having
seen so many cases wherein the conditions described in this chapter were
so apparently&mdash;whether from ammoni&aelig;mia due to infection, or
tox&aelig;mia from the urinary tract, or ur&aelig;mic tox&aelig;mia from
the intestinal tract&mdash;all due to some preputial interference or
irritation, I cannot help but feel that in these conditions&mdash;which,
singularly, are not so prevalent with the Hebrews as with
Christians&mdash;we have one factor in the cause of the shorter and more
precarious vitality of the latter.</p>

<p>Morel, in his &ldquo;Trait&eacute; des D&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;rescences Phisiques,&rdquo; ably
discusses the degenerative and morbific influences and results of
tox&aelig;mia, as well as he clearly defines their sources. The connection
between tox&aelig;mia and mental affections has already been shown, and Prof.
Hobart A. Hare, in his instructive and interesting prize essay on
&ldquo;La Pathog&eacute;nie et la Th&eacute;rapeutique de l&rsquo;&Eacute;pilepsie
(Bruxelles, 1890)&rdquo;, mentions that convulsive disorders resulting
from the presence of some toxic substance are of frequent occurrence.
How much this may enter as a partial factor into many of the cases of
epilepsy which are classed in the order of &ldquo;reflex&rdquo; may well
challenge our consideration. Hare lays great stress on the necessity of
circumcision wherever there is an indication of preputial local
irritation. &ldquo;If practicable, circumcision should be performed; it
is an operation with but small risk or danger, and easy of performance.
In such circumstances it is always permissible to circumcise, were it
for no other end than an acknowledged attempt to reach a cure.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class='sc sf75'>Surgical Operations Performed on the Prepuce.</span></h2>

<p>In operative interference there is one point which should not be lost
sight of, this being that the length and bulk of the prepuce in a great
measure depends on the constriction at its orifice; if the orifice is
small, the prepuce tight and inelastic, every erection, by putting the
penis-integument on the stretch, adds to its bulk,&mdash;nature naturally
trying to make up the deficiency,&mdash;the two points of resistance being
where the glans pushes it ahead, having the constricting orifice for a
hold or purchase, and the skin at the pubes, which is called upon to
furnish the extra tissue for the time being needed during erection,
which should be supplied by the prepuce&mdash;this being the only office
which I have been able to assign to this otherwise useless but very
mischievous appendage. In cases where preputial irritation produces more
or less priapism, the continued stretching of this integument causes a
marked increase in its growth, which is mostly added forward. It was on
this principle or its recognition, that Celsus devised his operations,
and on which the persecuted Jews undertook to recover their glans by
manufacturing a prepuce; and, although the trial was not reported as
being very successful, I do not doubt but that, if the skin could have
been drawn sufficiently over so as to constrict it anteriorly so as to
give the glans a purchase, as in the case of phimosis with an inelastic
prepuce, the operation could be more of a success; all that is required
is the continued extension and the prepuce might be made <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
to rival in length the labia major&aelig; of the females of some
African tribes, or the pendulous buttocks of the Hottentot Venus.</p>

<p>I have employed the knowledge of this elasticity and source of supply of
the penis-integument, on more than one occasion, in recovering the
denuded organ with skin. A number of cases are on record where, owing to
the want of that artistic and mechanical knowledge without which no
surgeon is perfect, the operator has drawn forward the skin too tight in
circumcising, after which, owing to the natural elasticity of the skin,
the integument has retracted, leaving the penis like a skinned eel or
sausage. This accident is even liable to occur where the skin has not
been tightly drawn, but where subsequent erections have torn through the
sutures, and where the natural retraction of the skin has laid the organ
bare for some distance. I have seen a number so recorded, but do not
remember seeing any remedy suggested, it seemingly being accepted that
the recovery must take place by gradual granulation,&mdash;a necessarily very
slow process, owing to the constant interference by&mdash;the always present
in such cases&mdash;unavoidable erections.</p>

<p>Several years ago I advised circumcision to a gentleman owing to a
contracted condition of the muscles of one hip and thigh, which was
threatening to render him a deformed cripple; he had a congenital
phimosis and a very irritable glans penis. The operation was performed
in a proper manner by a surgical friend, but this friend, unfortunately,
was a great believer in antiseptic and wet dressings. A few days after
the operation he called upon me to ask me to go and see the patient, as
they were both in a pickle, the patient being exceedingly angry, being
in constant misery, and the penis so <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
denuded by the giving way of the sutures&mdash;owing to the
erections&mdash;that it looked to the patient as if he never could have
a whole penis again, and the doctor saw no way out of the difficulty;
the penis was, in reality, a dilapidated and sorrowful-looking
appendage, and anything else but a thing of beauty or pride; it was raw,
angry-looking, and bleeding at every move; the first wink of sleep was
followed by an attempt at erection that raised the patient as
effectually as an Indian would in scalping him; so that, taken
altogether, the penis, anxious countenance, and the flexed position of
the whole body to relieve the tension on the organ, the man looked about
as battered, cast down, and sorrowful as Don Quixote did in the garret
of the old Spanish inn, with his plastered ribs and demolished
lantern-jaw.</p>

<p>Luckily, the patient was seen before the retracted portion of the penile
integument had had a chance to condense and indurate. The bed was
slopping wet with the drenchings of carbolized water that the penis had
undergone, the man&rsquo;s clothing was necessarily damp, and the whole
bedding and clothes were steamy,&mdash;all of which greatly added to his
discomfort and tendency to erections. The man was washed, placed in a
new, clean, and dry bed, and his clothing changed. The organ was then
forced backward until the preputial frill or edge was approximated to
the cut end of the penis-skin, where it was made fast by an
uninterrupted suture around the whole of the circumference. A short
catheter, about three inches in length,&mdash;the catheter being as full size
as the urethra would comfortably hold, and of the best and thickest of
the red, stiff variety,&mdash;was introduced into the urethra. This protruded
about half an inch beyond the meatus. A stiff, square piece of
card-board was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
pierced and slipped over this, and then adhesive rubber straps were
brought from the integument to this little platform, the first being
from the median line of the scrotum, lifting the sac forward and upward.
The pubes were shaved and the next four straps started from the root of
the penis, each strap being split at the glans-end so as to encircle the
protruding end of the catheter. By these means the skin was brought back
and firmly supported over the penis, toward the glans; and, in case of
any erection, the act would only assist in drawing the covering farther
over the penis as the pasteboard platform and adhesive straps formed the
distal end of an artificial phimosis. The catheter allowed of free
urination, and the scrotum was further held up in position by a flat
suspensory bandage passed underneath the scrotum and fastened over the
abdomen near each hip. The penis wound was then dressed with a very
little benzoated oxide-of-zinc ointment passed between the adhesive
straps; a bridge-support placed over the hips to support the
bed-clothes, and all was finished, and full doses of bromide of sodium
and chloral were ordered at bed-time. When the dressings were removed,
five days afterward, all was healed, the sutures removed, and the
suspensory alone replaced. The patient had not been troubled with any
more erections or annoyances of any kind. These are the points which
often do more or less mischief: wet dressings are uncomfortable and
favor erections, while the effect of the weight and action of the
scrotum in drawing backward on the integument should not be overlooked;
in addition, it should not be overlooked that we have it in our power to
produce, so to speak, an artificial phimotic action, which has the same
traction on the penis-integument that the natural phimosis induces.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
The foregoing method, to be used in these cases, has proved very
serviceable in my hands, and it is here given that it may assist others;
as there is no need of waiting for granulations or of allowing the
patient to undergo so much misery, which, besides the local injury,
cannot help but affect the general health very injuriously. The penis
can stand any amount of forcing backward; it stands this in cancer or
hypertrophy of the prepuce, or in the inflammatory thickenings that
precede gangrene of the prepuce, in any extended degree; becoming, for
the time being, more or less atrophied. As has been shown by Lisfranc,
the penis can be made nearly to disappear into the pubes; so that we are
not as helpless in these cases as our text-books would have us believe.</p>

<p>In infants, and in young children below the age of ten or twelve, the
Jewish operation, as modified and done in accordance with the dictates
of modern surgery, will be found the most expedient. By this method we
avoid the need of any an&aelig;sthetic agents, which are more or less
dangerous with children, as well as the need of sutures, which are
painful of adjustment and very annoying to remove in those little
fellows who dread new harm; there is also much less risk of
h&aelig;mmorrhages, as the frenal artery is not wounded. In children of a year
or over, a very good result will be found often to follow
Cloquet&rsquo;s operation, care being taken to carry the slitting well
back, as well as care in taking it on one side of the frenum, so as to
avoid any wound of that artery, the subsequent dressing being a small
Maltese-cross bandage, pierced so as to admit the glans to pass through;
the prepuce is retracted and the tails folded over each other and held
there by a small strip of rubber adhesive plaster; a little vaselin
prevents the soiling by urine underneath. This last operation is short
and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
very easy, is not painful, nor does it require much manipulation;
it is only one quick cut on the grooved director and it is over; by the
retraction of the prepuce, the longitudinal cut becomes a transverse
one, making the prepuce wider and shorter at once; the glans soon
develops and remains uncovered. As there is a very small wound to heal
over, the repair is very prompt.</p>

<p>In adults with a very narrow, thin, not overlong prepuce, a very good
result often follows a combination of the dorsal slit with the inferior
slit alongside of the frenum of Cloquet. The narrower and tighter the
prepuce, the better the result, as the cuts are at once converted from
longitudinal into transverse wounds, and the organ at once assumes the
shape and condition of a circumcised organ, without having suffered any
loss of substance; three stitches or sutures in each cut (silver or
catgut) adjust the cut edges; a small roller of lint and adhesive
plaster, placed so as to shoulder up against the corona, completes the
dressing. Where this operation is practicable, by the <ins class='corr'
title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed
&lsquo;thinnes&rsquo;.">thinness</ins> and narrowness of the prepuce, it has
many advantages. I have repeatedly performed it on lawyers,
book-keepers, clerks, and even laboring men, who have gone from the
office to the courts, counting-rooms, or stores without the least
resulting inconvenience or loss of time. In laborers it is better to
perform the operation on a Saturday evening, which gives them a rest of
thirty-six hours before going to their labor again. The operation is
comparatively painless and almost bloodless, as there need not be more
than half a teaspoonful of blood lost during the operation; there is no
danger of any subsequent h&aelig;morrhage, and, with proper precautions
against the occurrence of erections, from seventy-two to ninety-six
hours is sufficient for a complete union; the sutures are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
then removed and a simple lint and adhesive-plaster dressing worn for a
few days more. In many, no more dressings are required. In many cases,
with a properly adjusted dressing, that comes forward underneath so as
to include the frenum, the simple dorsal slit is sufficient; but if any
of the prepuce depasses the dressing underneath, it will puff and become
&oelig;dematous and require frequent puncturing. To avoid it, it is
better to make the Cloquet slit at once. This operation is of no value,
and perfectly impracticable in a thick, pendulous prepuce. Absorption
will often remove considerable preputial tissue, but where there is too
much its very bulk interferes with its removal by any natural means.</p>

<p>Dilatation is recommended by a number of surgeons, but, I must admit, in
my hands it has always proved a failure; it may be, that if the
subsequent history of the cases reported as so operated upon had been
carefully traced, the reports would not have been so good. Nelaton,
whose dilating instrument is generally recommended, seems, himself, to
prefer some of the circumcising methods, as in the volume on
&ldquo;Diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs,&rdquo; in his
&ldquo;Surgery,&rdquo; being the sixth volume of the revised edition of
1884, by Despr&egrave;s, Gillettte, and Horteloup, the subject of dilatation is
dismissed in two short lines. St. Germain, of Paris, uses, as has been
before observed, a two-bladed forceps, used after the manner of Nelaton,
and reports good results. Dr. J. Lewis Smith agrees in his statements
with Dr. St. Germain. Dr. Holgate, of New York, reports a like
experience. In my own practice the prepuce has often been made
<i>temporarily</i> lax and retractable, but with the usual results of the
return of the contraction, with a possible thickening of the inner fold,
as a result of the interference; so that only in case of any immediate
demand, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
where the tight prepuce is producing irritation, either through
pressure or adhesions, or retained sebaceous matter, do I ever resort to
dilatation; always, however, even then, not as a final operation, but
merely as preparatory procedure toward a future operation of a more
efficient order.</p>

<p>In cases of timid adults, who refuse all kinds of operative
interference, good results may be obtained by the use of a mild
lead-wash or cold tea-baths and the introduction of flat layers of dry
lint interposed between the prepuce and the glans; this has a very good
effect in keeping the parts apart and dry, and may in time produce a
certain amount of dilatation; but even when this is done, unless it will
render the foreskin sufficiently loose to allow of its being kept
finally back of the corona, it is, after all, but a temporary makeshift.
The corona should be exposed and kept clear of the preputial covering;
anything short of this will not give all the good results to be desired.
I have more than once performed a secondary operation on Jews, who had
been imperfectly circumcised by not having the prepuce removed
sufficiently, and in whom the subsequent contraction of the preputial
orifice had re-covered part of the glans, and only lately visited a
four-year-old boy, circumcised when eight days old, in whom the prepuce
covered half of the glans, the corona acting as a tractive point from
which the penile integument was being drawn forward. In this case the
simple pierced-lint Maltese cross was used, with an adhesive band to
hold the tails down behind and around the penis just back of the corona.</p>

<p>These means, although not circumcision either in a surgical or in the
Hebraic religious sense, are, nevertheless, sufficient in a medical
sense for all desired purposes; provided, however, that there is no
resulting constriction, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
or a mild condition of paraphimosis, back of the corona, and that the
whole of the glans is sufficiently uncovered, and that no abnormal
dog-ears are left to garnish each side of the penis like an Elizabethan
frill or collar; although Agnew holds that, in slitting, the practice
adopted by many of rounding off the corners is mostly superfluous, as
nature will do so itself in time.</p>

<p>The ordinary way of performing the operation by modern surgeons is by
what is known as the Bumstead circumcision. It was not an invention of
Bumstead, but was adopted by him in preference to all others. The
requisites are a sharp-pointed bistoury, blunt-pointed scissors, and a
pair of Henry&rsquo;s phimosis forceps, with fine needles and fine
oculists&rsquo; suture silk. The penis is allowed to hang naturally and
the position of the corona glandis marked on the outer skin with a pen
and ink, which is to serve as a guide for the incision. The prepuce is
now drawn forward until this line is brought in front of the glans and
grasped between the blades of the forceps. The prepuce is now
transfixed, and, with a downward cut, that portion is severed; the
knife&rsquo;s edge is now turned upward and the excision finished. The
forceps are now removed and the integument allowed to retract; with the
scissors the inner mucous fold is now split along the dorsum and trimmed
off so as to leave about half an inch in front of the corona. The parts
are then brought together with the continuous suture and dressed
according to the fancy of the surgeon. Care must be taken <i>not to
bruise</i> the parts with the forceps, as, in such cases, sloughing of the
sutured edges will be the result instead of union. I have seen this
accident happen more than once, in one case being followed by a penitis
that seriously complicated matters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
It has been my practice to use fine silver-wire and catgut sutures in
all operations on the prepuce; they excite less suppuration as well as
less irritation. In case of need, the silver can be left in longer, and
they are much easier of removal than the silk; besides, they have the
advantage of not cutting. In the after-treatment the same general plan
can be followed as with any amputated stump, except that it must not be
forgotten that at the end of this organ dwells what has been termed the
<i>sixth</i> sense, and that heat and moisture are very apt to awaken the
dormant energies of the organ, even after it has undergone cruel
mutilation, and even has suffered considerable loss of blood; for that
reason it is best always to avoid wet or sloppy dressing, or too much
ointment, as they are more apt to cause erection than to do any good.
Besides, I find water does here, as elsewhere, interfere with the
deposited plastic matter, properly organizing into cicatricial tissue;
so that I prefer a snug, dry dressing, which is left on for four or five
days without being interfered with, and light covering, plain diet,
quiet, with fifteen grains each of bromide of sodium and chloral hydrate
at bed-time to insure rest and freedom from annoying erections. Where
the organ is large in its flaccid state, it is better to support it on a
small oakum-stuffed pillow, made for the purpose, than to let it hang
downward. Should the stitches give way and the skin tend to retract, the
plan proposed on a previous page can be followed to advantage. In
urinating, care must be taken not to soil the dressings; some patients
are very careless about this if not warned. The penis should hang nearly
perpendicular while in the act, and all dribbling should have ceased and
the meatus and underneath be mopped dry with some soft cotton before
raising the organ; nothing so irritates the parts, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
retards union, or is more offensive than a urine-saturated dressing.</p>

<p>Dr. Hue, of Rouen, uses an elastic ligature, which he introduces into
the dorsal aspect of the prepuce by means of a curved needle. This he
ties in front, and in three or four days it cuts its way through.
Although Hue reports a large number so operated upon, the tediousness of
the procedure and the swelling and &oelig;dema, as well as the active pain
that must necessarily accompany the operation, will hardly recommend the
ligature in preference to the incision by the knife.</p>

<p>Dr. Bernheim, the surgeon of the Israelitish Consistory of Paris, has
operated on over eleven hundred circumcisions, besides the cases of
phimosis occurring in his general practice. His opinion of the procedure
of M. de Saint-Germain by dilatation is not favorable. He has employed
it in a number of cases of phimosis, at the time unfit for a more
radical operation. He has, however, observed that cicatricial
thickenings and recontractions are very apt to occur, and, as to the
septic accidents mentioned in connection with circumcision, he has noted
that they are as liable to occur in hands that are as careless and
slovenly with what they do with their dilating forceps as they are with
what they do with their bistouries. Dr. Bernheim prefers the
circumcision forceps of Ricord, as modified by M. Mathieu. This
instrument he prefers by reason of its gentler pressure, which, at the
same time, is all-sufficient to properly fix the prepuce. In applying
the forceps, he includes as little as possible of the lower part,
keeping away as much as possible from the frenic artery. The dorsum of
the inner fold he cuts with the scissors. In children under two years of
age, he simply turns this back over the free edge of the integument; in
children over two <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
years of age, he uses serres-fines. In children, he uses a piece of
lint dressing steeped in a watery solution of boracic acid; in adults,
he uses iodoform-gauze dressings. He finds cases unite in from three to
ten days. Dr. Bernheim warns us against using antiseptics on infants or
young children, in connection with the after-dressing of circumcision.
Neither phenic acid, corrosive sublimate, nor iodoform are well borne by
these young subjects, and he has seen serious results follow upon as
light an application as a 1/100 solution of phenic acid. In a number of
cases he reports operating with the galvano-cautery of Chardin, instead
of the knife. These operations were bloodless, and cicatrization was as
rapid as when the knife was used. He has in several cases operated by
the dorsal incision, owing to disease of the prepuce not allowing any
other operation.</p>

<p>In France, the Bumstead operation is known under the title of
Ricord&rsquo;s procedure. Lisfranc, Malapert, M. Coster, and Vidal all
have operations which are not as useful as Ricord&rsquo;s, and have not,
therefore, come into general use. M. Sedillot condemns the dorsal
incision as leaving two unsightly-looking flaps. The reverse, or
inferior incision of M. Jules Cloquet is likewise not in favor with
either Malgaigne or Ricord. This inferior incision or section, alongside
of the frenum was first advised by Celsus. M. Cullerier contented
himself with slitting the inner preputial fold, longitudinally, from its
junction with the skin backward to the corona. M. Chauvin, by the aid of
a complicated instrument with barbed points, drew out the mucous fold as
far as possible before excising.</p>

<p>There is something unaccountable in the difference in results that
various operations give in the hands of different surgeons. It must be
that all methods are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
correct <i>with properly-chosen cases</i> and when properly <i>performed</i>, as
well as properly looked after subsequently to the operation. It must not
be expected, however, that, in operations where the kindly assistance of
nature is a thing contemplated in absorbing superfluous tissue, the case
will at once give satisfaction to all. These cases must have the
required time before judgment can be passed upon the merits of the
operation, just as required time in cases of dilatation or in the method
of M. Cullerier will often demonstrate that the benefits are but
transient, and that often even cases that have been so operated upon
will require a complete circumcision, <i>&agrave; la</i> Ricord or <i>&agrave;
la</i> Bumstead, owing to the resulting thickening induration and
overconstriction, when, if left alone, the dorsal slitting or the
inferior incision of Cloquet would have previously given satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>The final cosmetic results in the combined Cloquet and dorsal-slit
operation, for instance, depend on, first, properly choosing the case.
One on whom the operation is unadaptable it is useless to attempt it on,
as a future circumcision or tedious and annoying re-operation of
trimming would be required. The next care is to properly cut through all
constricting bands, which, like fine, tough strings, will be found to
encircle the penis. These must be carefully clipped with a fine pair of
strabismus scissors, as these bands do not give way, either then or
afterward, of their own accord, but form the nucleus for stronger
constricting bands for the future. Then you must be sure to cut far
enough back, either above or below, until you have reached where you
obtain the normal and largest calibre of circumference of the penis. The
adaptation of the edges of the parts and the proper application of a
smooth, equal pressure, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
by means of the lint strap, is of the next importance; and then comes
the strapping of the whole surface for about an inch and a half back of
the corona, which should and must include all the tissues of the
preputial part of the frenum. A neglect or careless performance of any
of the details, or the carelessness of the patient in not keeping the
dressing clean, necessitating its change before the fourth day, all tend
not only to interrupt the union, but to mar the future cosmetic results
as well. It may be asked why all this care and trouble, and not
circumcise at once? As already observed, this operation admits of the
patient following his business; whereas circumcision, on the male, will
assuredly lay him up for four or five days, and perhaps ten
days,&mdash;something that many, be they rich or poor, cannot afford,
and will not submit to.</p>

<p>The cosmetic condition of the penis as a copulating organ is a thing of
some importance, and this should not be overlooked; for, although the
particular dimension, shape, or peculiarity of the penile end never
figures prominently in the complaints of women who apply for
divorce,&mdash;the charges being everything else under the sun,&mdash;it can
safely be assumed that this organ and its condition is the original,
silent and unseen, as well as unconscious power behind the throne that
is at the bottom of the whole business in more than one case. Like the
fable of the poor lamb that the wolf wished to devour: the real reason
of his wishing to kill him was that he might eat him, the pretext set
forth by the wolf that the lamb had encroached on his pasture, muddied
his brook, or kept him awake by his bleating having been disproven by
the lamb. Besides, it is well not to leave any distinctive or
distinguishing mark, like an individual baronial crest, on the head of
the organ.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
To return, however, to the operative procedures, we find that Dr. Vanier
finds that the operation of Cloquet by incision alongside of the frenum
has the advantage of not leaving any deformity&mdash;contrary to the opinion
of Ricord and Malgaigne. He, in fact, holds this procedure in such high
esteem that he considers that Cloquet deserves great credit for reviving
this old Celsian operation. H. H. Smith, in his &ldquo;Operative
Surgery,&rdquo; coincides with Vanier in his favorable opinion of this
method, as he there says: &ldquo;Frequent opportunities of testing the
advantages of the plan of Cloquet having satisfied me of its value, I do
not hesitate to recommend it as that best adapted to the adult, because
it fully exposes the glans and leaves little or no lateral deformity, as
is frequently the case with the dorsal incision,&rdquo;&mdash;an opinion that
I can fully agree with, from the results of the same operation in my
hands, although I have used the method even on infants. Vanier does not
approve of the dorsal incision unless it is made <span style='font-family:sans-serif; font-size:120%;'>V</span>-shaped, as it
otherwise leaves the unsightly lateral flaps, but thinks well of the
modification of Cloquet&rsquo;s practiced by M. Vidal de Cassis, which
is performed in the following manner: The patient stands before the
operator, who remains sitting; the operator seizes the prepuce on its
dorsum and draws it toward him; he then introduces a narrow,
sharp-pointed bistoury, with its point armed with a small waxen bullet,
down alongside of the frenum until he reaches the pouched extremity of
the preputial cavity at this point; the point of the bistoury is now
made to transfix the waxen bullet and out through the skin, which from
this point is divided from behind forward. Vanier very sensibly suggests
that the operation that is effectual, and which can be accomplished in
the least number of movements or <i>temps</i>, as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
being the least likely to cause extensive pain and agony, should be the
one preferred, and that the aim of the surgeon should be to simplify the
operation by reducing the number of necessary movements. For this
reason, where an excision of considerable amount of tissue is required
by the nature of the case, he prefers another operation, performed by
Lallemand,&mdash;that of making a dorsal transfixion and cutting off the
two lateral flaps, which can all be done in three movements.</p>

<p>It makes but little difference as to which operation is performed on the
adult, but that the subsequent dressing will exercise a good or evil
influence, and greatly assist not only in the present comfort or
discomfort of the patient, but in the ultimate result as well. Bearing
these points in view, Charles A. Ballance, of St. Thomas&rsquo;s
Hospital, has adopted the following procedure:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the patient is etherized, the outline of the posterior
border of the glans is marked on the skin with an aniline pencil. The
skin of the prepuce is slit and removed up to the aniline line. The
mucous membrane is next cut away, leaving only a free edge of about
one-eighth of an inch in width. Any bleeding which occurs should be
entirely arrested, and asepsis must be insured by frequent sponging with
carbolic or sublimate solution. Numerous coarse-hair stitches are then
inserted, so as to bring accurately together the fresh-cut edges of the
skin and mucous membrane, and subsequently, after a further sponging and
drying, a piece of gauze two layers of thickness, and wide enough to
reach from the root of the penis nearly to the meatus, is wrapped
loosely around the penis and secured by several applications of the
collodion-brush. The setting of the collodion is hastened by the use of
a fan, so that the air <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
is kept in motion, and the patient should not be allowed to recover
from the an&aelig;sthetic until the dressing is quite firm and hard.
This dressing forms a carapace for the penis, protecting it from the
bedclothes and effectually preventing the annoying and distressing
erections. Mr. Ballance reports excellent results from this
dressing.&rdquo; (Braithwaite&rsquo;s <i>Retrospect</i>, July, 1888.)</p>

<p>In applying the above dressing, the shrinking incident to the drying of
the collodion must not be overlooked, and the gauze layers must be
loosely applied, as they would otherwise become too tight. The dressing
is a very ingenious and serviceable one.</p>

<p>Mr. A. G. Miller, at a meeting of the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical
Society, reported a new method of dressing after circumcision. &ldquo;It
consisted in first closely suturing the skin and mucous membrane by
numerous catgut sutures, then painting the surface with Friar&rsquo;s
balsam and covering it over with two or three layers of cotton wadding,
on which the balsam is poured. The glans penis was left sufficiently
free to allow of water passing. The band or ring of dressing should be
at least one inch broad. The dressing was not suitable for young infants
who were frequently wetting. In the case of older children, they might
be allowed to go about on the second or third day, when the dressing
would be quite dry, and would not be required to be changed or
renewed.&rdquo; (Braithwaite&rsquo;s <i>Retrospect</i>, January, 1888.)</p>

<p>Any constricting or immovable and inelastic dressing is subject to the
same objections as plaster-of-Paris dressings in thigh-fractures,&mdash;that
of being dangerous and not expedient, unless the patient is constantly
under your eye.</p>

<p>Dr. Neil Macleod, in the <i>Edinburgh Medical Journal</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
for March, 1883, advises a procedure that has always looked favorably
to me, and which I once put in practice through the means of the
ordinary ptosis fenestrated forceps, in place of the ordinary
circumcision forceps, the sutures being introduced through the fenestra
and the prepuce cut off on the outer side of the forceps, the thickness
of the steel arm on the outer side of the fenestra allowing of the
properly-sized border for the hold of the sutures. Dr. Macleod places
his sutures all in position before making any incisions,&mdash;a
procedure which will be found to save the patient considerable pain; as
with many the seizing and holding of the edges of the skin and mucous
membrane and the forcible pressure exerted by the fingers or forceps
while the needle is being forced through is the most painful part of the
operation. In doing this, care must be taken to allow sufficient length
to each thread to make two sutures, as well as care must be taken to
properly pull out the thread in the centre between the four folds of
tissue and to cut it equidistant, after the ablation of the prepuce, a
blunt hook being used to fish up the threads from the preputial opening.</p>

<p>Erichsen favors the Jewish operation in young children, as being the
easiest and safest of performance. Slitting, or the inferior or superior
incision, he thought, left too much of the prepuce, which, wherever
there is a tendency to phimosis, should be entirely removed, &ldquo;with
a view of preserving the health and cleanliness of the parts in after
life.&rdquo; In the phimosis that is acquired by old men, he found
dilatation with a two-bladed instrument to be sufficient, provided the
indurated circle was made to yield. For the circumcision of adults he
has invented an adjustable shield, something like the Jewish spatula,
with which he protects the glans.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Gross (the elder) used both slitting on the dorsum and circumcision. He
found neither objection nor deformity in the flaps left by the dorsal
incision, as they were only temporary; in some cases, he simply followed
the practice of Cullerier, of making multiple slits in the constricting
and inelastic mucous membrane.</p>

<p>Agnew believes in circumcision in the treatment of reflex troubles. He
relates a case, in the second volume of his &ldquo;Surgery,&rdquo; of
eczema extending over the abdomen, of over a year&rsquo;s standing,
cured in a child by circumcision; he operates by incision on the dorsum,
in which he leaves nature to make away with the flaps, or he circumcises
by the Bumstead method.</p>

<p>Van Buren and Keyes recommend both the incision on the dorsum and the
operation of Ricord; where the mucous membrane alone is tight and
constricted, they follow Cullerier&rsquo;s method of either single or
multiple incisions of the inner coat. They lay great stress on the
necessity of keeping the patient quietly in bed to insure rapid and
complete union.</p>

<p>My friend, Dr. Robert J. Gregg, of San Diego, has lately operated on a
number of cases, the operation being perfectly painless, the little
patients submitting to it and feeling no more pain than if it were
having its toe-nails trimmed, the local an&aelig;sthesia being produced by the
hypodermatic injection of cocaine. This procedure is now used to a
considerable extent throughout the country, and it is a far safer and
more comfortable performance than either etherizing or chloroforming, as
the sudden and spasmodic filling of the lungs of young children&mdash;who
will resist and hold their breath for a long time, then suddenly
inhale&mdash;with an&aelig;sthetic vapor is almost unavoidable, having in two
instances nearly lost two children from such an accident.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Dr. G. W. Overall, in a late <i>Medical Record</i>, which is quoted in the
<i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> of February 21, 1891,
gives the description of a very good and painless method of producing
this local an&aelig;sthesia; for it need hardly be said that with a nervous,
irritable child the introduction of the hypodermatic needle is as
formidable an operation as either slitting or the Jewish operation. Dr.
Overall is in the habit of holding a solution within the preputial
cavity and then to introduce the needle in the mucous fold, having
previously applied a light rubber band back of the corona, on the outer
integument, so as to act like a tourniquet and limit the action of the
an&aelig;sthetic effect to the prepuce. By this procedure he avoids all pain
and the operation can be performed while the child is even amusing
itself, care being taken that it does not see it. Sutures that require
removal should not be used, according to the Doctor, and the operation
thereby becomes a perfectly painless and unalarming performance to the
patient in all its details.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Dr. Delange mentions a peculiar social habit or custom
among a tribe of Arabians that in a sociological sense is worth
mentioning. He observes that for these dances females are preferred, but
owing to the peculiar habit about to be related it is impossible to have
any of the village women in Algeria assist at this part of the
festivities; hence the men have to do the dancing. It appears that the
females of one tribe&mdash;this being the tribe of Ouleds-Nails, who live on
the southern borders of Algiers&mdash;are in the habit, when young, of
emigrating to the oases of the Sahara, which are occupied by the French
and traveling Arabs, where they give themselves up to a life of
prostitution. After having exercised this life for some years they
return to the tribe with a dowry in money, besides an ample supply of
clothes and jewelry,&mdash;the result of their economy,&mdash;which enables them
to contract favorable marriages. This practice is so common in this one
particular tribe, and so much have they monopolized the profession of
courtesan, that the name of the tribe of Ouleds-Nails is in Arabia
synonymous with that of courtesan. These young women dance every evening
in the Arab caf&eacute;s, and are at times employed to do the dancing at Arab
feasts. For this reason no self-respecting Arab woman ever allows
herself to dance in public, or why the practice of both sexes dancing
together is not practiced in Algerian villages, as a man would thereby
consider himself disgraced.&mdash;Dr. Delange, in <i>Receuil de M&eacute;moires de
M&eacute;decine de Chirurgie et de Pharmacie Militaire</i>, No. 105, August,
1868.</p></div>

prepuce were published in the <i>Journal l&rsquo;Excommunier</i> in January
of 1870, when the writer was in France. They were contributed by A. S.
Morin, of Miron, a learned historiographer and antiquary. Europe has not
recovered from its love of the supernatural that it had so strongly in
the middle ages. The blood of St. Gennaro still liquefies once a year,
and many churches still claim to possess the identical winding sheet
that served our Lord prior to his resurrection, as well as more than one
church has the holy cloth that St. Veronica used on the way to Calvary,
which has an impression of the face of the Saviour.</p></div>

foundation. The tradition relates that in the dark ages some
sacrilegious soldier had robbed a church in the neighborhood of its holy
vessels of gold and silver. In the vessel in the Tabernacle there
happened to be a consecrated wafer. The soldier journeyed on to Turin to
dispose of his plunder, when, on arriving at the spot on which the
church now stands, the wafer is said to have ascended miraculously to
some distance above the soldier&rsquo;s head, while at the same time the
mule he rode, being imbued with more religious piety than his master,
reverently knelt down on his front legs. The holy wafer was now
encircled by a halo of shining light; this, with the kneeling donkey and
the soldier raining blows on the pious animal, while he himself was
unconscious of the presence of the host above him, attracted the
attention of the populace, who apprehended the soldier, on whom the
stolen vessels were found. The bishop in his pontificial robes, in
solemn procession, received the consecrated wafer, which promptly
descended into pious hands. The donkey was adopted by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the bishop and the soldier was promptly hanged, in accordance with the
general treatment of thieves in those days. The writer has more than
once seen a flagstone inclosed within a railing that occupies the
central spot of the floor or pavement of the church, it being the
identical spot on which the donkey knelt.</p></div>

the Hebrew race as descendants of Isaac and the Arab race as the
descendants of Ishmael, from whom sprung the Saracenic people. These are
the only two races that have gone on in their purity from their
beginning. They intermarry only among themselves and have, alike, the
same customs and habits as their fathers. The sculptured faces of the
Hebrew on the Babylonian monuments are the same faces that are met in
the synagogues of Paris or New York. So with the descendants of Ishmael,
in whom there flows partly the blood of the dominant element of ancient
Egypt; neither custom, habit, nor physiognomy have changed. In these two
races, as observed by Bishop Newton, we have an ocular demonstration of
the Divine origin of our faith, if verification of Scripture history is
any criterion.&mdash;&ldquo;Clarke&rsquo;s Commentary,&rdquo; vol. i, page

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_60_60" id="Footnote_60_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> Among the Semitic race, however, it seems possible to
bring forward better evidence than this of an early Stone Age. If we
follow one way of translating we find, in two passages of the Old
Testament, an account of the use of sharp stones or stone knives for
circumcision,&mdash;Exodus, iv, 25: &ldquo;And Zipporah took a stone&rdquo;;
and Joshua, v, 2: &ldquo;At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make thee
knives of stone.&rdquo; ... The Septuagint altogether favors the opinion
that the knives in question were of stone, by reading, in the first
place, a stone or pebble, and, in the second, stone knives of sharp-cut
stone. These are mentioned again in the remarkable passage which follows
the account of the death and burial of Joshua (Joshua, xxiv, 29,
30),&mdash;&ldquo;And it came to pass, after these things, that Joshua, the
son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years
old, and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath
Serah, which is in Mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of
Gaash.&rdquo; Here follows, in the LXX, a passage not in the Hebrew
text, which has come down to us: &ldquo;And there they laid with him in
the tomb, wherein they buried him there, the stone knives wherewith he
circumcised the children of Israel at the Gilgals, when he led them out
of Egypt, as the Lord commanded. And they are there unto this
day.&rdquo; The rabbinical law, in connection with this subject, reads
as follows: &ldquo;We may circumcise with anything, even with a flint,
with crystal (glass), or with anything that cuts, except with the sharp
edge of a reed, because enchanters made use of that, or it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>may bring on
a disease; and it is a precept of the wise men to circumcise with iron,
whether in the form of a knife or scissors, but it is customary to use a
knife.&rdquo; This mention of the objectionable nature of the reed as a
circumcising medium is attributed to the danger that may arise from
splinters. The Fiji Islanders use both a rattan knife and a sharp
splinter of bamboo in performing circumcision and in cutting the
umbilical cord at child-birth. Herodotus mentions the use of stone
knives by the Egyptian embalmers. Stone knives were supposed to produce
less inflammation than those of bronze or iron, and it was for this
reason that the Cybelian priests operated upon themselves with a sherd
of Samian ware (Samia testa), as thus avoiding danger. There seems, on
the whole, to be a fair case for believing that among the Israelites, as
in Arabia, Ethiopia, and Egypt, a ceremonial use of stone instruments
long survived the general adoption of metal, and that such observances
are to be interpreted as relics of an earlier Stone
Age.&mdash;&ldquo;Researches into the Early History of Mankind.&rdquo; By

atrophy of the testicle in the aged may not at times be partly due to
the compression exercised by the prepuce on the glans through reflex
action, and whether at times the virility that is departing cannot be
restored by circumcision in such cases. I have seen such results, being
guided to the idea by the Biblical relation in the case of Abraham.</p></div>

following on an attack of fever. The man was in his prime, and had been
of most exemplary habits. The fever that he had was, I had every reason
to believe, directly due to the results of imperfect blood depuration
incident on the irritability of his kidneys, which, retroactively, again
allowed the ur&aelig;mic condition to assume that dangerous degree that
suddenly and very unexpectedly to his friends and family ushered the
patient into eternity. This man had only been merely inconvenienced by
his prepuce up to the time that it caused his death. It is interesting
to observe what little trifles bring about the end of some men. The
unlucky habit of putting the royal countenance on paper brought Louis
XVI to a sudden halt at Varennes, and his head to the scaffold. The
lucky meeting of the <i>aides</i> of Bonaparte and Desaix between Novi and
Marengo gave to France its empire and to Europe the enlightenment that
was diffused by that event. If such trifles affect individuals and
nations, we must not be astonished that the little useless prepuce
should be endowed with the mischief-working power of the historical old
cow and kerosene lamp that reduced Chicago to ashes.</p></div>

&ldquo;Guy&rsquo;s Hospital Reports&rdquo; there is a most interesting
report at page 243 of a case of skin-grafting that was performed by
Thomas Bryant. The case was an extensive ulcer resulting from an injury.
Bryant took some skin-grafts from the man&rsquo;s arm and some from a
colored man in an adjoining bed. The account gives the daily report as
taken from the note-book of Mr. Clarke, and is accompanied by a colored
plate to illustrate the subject; the proliferation of the black skin is
astonishing. In closing the report Mr. Clarke says: &ldquo;But in the
figures depicted the amount of increase in the black patches will be
well seen. In ten weeks the four or five pieces of black skin, which
together were not larger than a grain of barley, had grown twentyfold,
and in an another month the black patch was more than one inch long by
half an inch broad, the black centres of cutification having clearly
grown very rapidly by the proliferation of their own black

Vidal in his work on &ldquo;Circumcision,&rdquo; at page 294, which
consisted in making, by a circular incision immediately back of the
glans, like in a circular amputation, a complete detachment of the
integument from back of the corona. The penis was then made to retreat
into the sheath thus made and a short catheter introduced into the
urethra, to the end of which the free end of the new preputial fold was
made fast, a piece of oiled lint being interposed between the raw inner
surface <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
and the glans. Another operation consisted in forcibly drawing the
integument forward and in making a number of transverse incisions in the
integument so as to assist its extensibility. By these means it was
drawn sufficiently forward so as to fasten it to a canula or catheter
made fast in the urethra. But it can well be imagined that a person must
possess the most exalted idea of the physiological needs of a prepuce
and feel the most sensitive need of such an appendage to submit to the
first of these operations, although it is more than probable that many
Jews submitted to the operation in the days of Celsus to avoid being
exiled or plundered of all their possessions. The resulting prepuce
could not have been a much more unsightly appendage than that which
ornaments the overburdened virile organ of many Christians, and there is
no doubt but that in many cases they passed muster.</p></div>

edition of the English translation of McDougall of Lallemand we find
that he fully appreciated the dangers that lurk in a prepuce. At page
216 he says: &ldquo;Such is the condition which the parts present in
cases of recent balanitis, and these are the inflammations and
ulcerations that cause more or less extensive adhesions of the prepuce
to the glans. Such adhesions are generally cellular, but sometimes
fibrous or even cartilaginous, according to the severity and frequent
repetition of the inflammation. Various degrees of induration also
results according to the intensity, the duration, and the frequency of
the phlogosis. Thus, I have often found a mucous membrane hardened,
thickened, and covered with numerous papill&aelig;, sometimes fibrous or
cartilaginous, with three times its natural thickness. I have also met
with cases in which the prepuce has become cancerous. I have operated in
several cases of cancer of the penis, too, which certainly arose from no
other cause. The patients were generally peasants between fifty and
sixty years of age, who had never known other than their own wives, but
who had frequently suffered from balanitis attended by abundant
discharge, swelling of the prepuce, and excoriation of its opening,
which was so contracted as to prevent the passage of the glans. I have
seen one case, also, in which balanitis, irritated by a forced march and
the abuse of alcoholic stimulants, passed into gangrene, by which the
greater part of the glans was destroyed. Such have been the accidents
which I have observed on those whose prepuce was too narrow to permit
the glans being uncovered; accidents which I can only attribute to the
long retention of the sebaceous matter in a kind of <i>cul-de-sac</i>, into
which a certain quantity of urine passes every time the patient makes
water.&rdquo;</p></div>

that the great number of the elderly people who are affected with

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_101_101" id="Footnote_101_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101_101"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> I have now under my care a poor consumptive who has all
the appearance of having always been as virtuous as Joseph, but who,
unlike Joseph, has from infancy had as a constant companion a long,
miserable, smegmanous, and annoying prepuce. The young man has an
&oelig;dema which first affected his feet, but one day, owing to the
irritation of a slight balanitis, the prepuce swelled at once; it
proceeded through the penis integument to the scrotum; the penis itself
retracted, leaving the integument and scrotum to assume a translucent,
puffy, cork-screw appearance and attitude; from its labyrinthic passage
the urine slowly dribbles during urination in a scalding stream. In
addition to the physical sufferings, he is tormented by the knowledge
that his friends attribute all his disease and troubles&mdash;since the
occurence of the penile &oelig;dema&mdash;to the fact that his earlier manhood
must have been indiscreet, as well as sinful. The laity cannot connect
any penile, scrotal, or testicular disease with anything except venereal
disease; and if the physician attempts to explain matters, they simply
look upon it as the good-natured and well-intentioned efforts of the
doctor to deceive them and to cover up the shortcomings of some frail
mortal. Many a poor fellow has to leave this world under a cloud of
mistrust and a bad odor of past deviltry to which he is not entitled,
and suffer all this in addition to all his physical ills, owing to his
having been ornamented through life with an annoying prepuce,&mdash;the
luckless heritage of having been born a Christian. Columbus in chains
moralizing on the ingratitude of this world is nothing to the poor
invalid with a swollen prepuce, innocently acquired, silently
&ldquo;cussing&rdquo; the ignorance of his relatives and friends.</p></div>

the action of numerous small carbuncles, resulting from the tox&aelig;mic
condition induced by the partial suppression of urine that he at times
suffered from, and, when nearly well, brought on a serious relapse by
the mail-bag appendage at the penis working up the organ into a state of
erection. While so situated he had intercourse, and from 99&deg; his
temperature immediately rose to 104&frac12;&deg;, where it remained for several
days, lengthening out his illness by several weeks, into a
long-protracted convalescence. The man is not yet circumcised, and, from
the knowledge that I have of his tendency to ur&aelig;mia, I feel that,
although in his prime, a fever or an accident may take him off at any

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_103_103" id="Footnote_103_103"></a><a href="#FNanchor_103_103"><span class="label">[103]</span></a> In looking over the literature of reflex neuroses and
more direct injurious results, I find that George Macilwain, in a work
on &ldquo;Surgical Observations on the More Important Diseases of the
Mucous Canals of the Body,&rdquo; published in London in 1830, calls
special attention to the case of a man aged thirty-eight, admitted to
the Finsbury Dispensary, and who was in the care of Mr. Hancock. The
patient was suffering from excruciating pain in different joints, the
pain <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
being so great that he was confined to his bed and unable to stand on
his feet. He was unable to rest at nights, and neither rheumatic nor any
other apparently suitable treatment was of any service. Rigors were soon
added to his other troubles, and during their continuance the pain in
his joints was greatly aggravated. He was referred to Mr. Macilwain for
treatment, who promptly relieved him by the removal of a urethral
stricture, which had quietly been the cause of all the disturbance. It
is particularly interesting that even at that early day the reflex
neuroses and complications that may arise from the irritability of the
genito-urinary organs were so well understood. How well Dr. Macilwain
appreciated the nicety of these relations can be seen from his remarks
in connection with the above case, in which he says: &ldquo;It may be
observed that the severity of the symptoms is not always commensurate
either with the duration of the disease or the degree of stricture, and
that, although the progressive development of them varies considerably
in rapidity, in different individuals, it is, nevertheless, in the
latter stages, always more rapid.&rdquo; Macilwain also graphically
describes the insidious approach of these genito-urinary troubles. In
speaking of stricture he says: &ldquo;Although minute inquiry generally
informs us that the stricture has been of some standing, and in some
instances has existed for years, yet it may happen that it is only a few
months or a year since the patient&rsquo;s attention has been directed
to the disease. This is very intelligible; for, in conformity with what
we observe in other parts of the body, the bladder has a power of
accommodating itself to a change of circumstances. Its strength, for a
long time, may increase so correctly in proportion to the increase of
the obstacle which opposes the ejection of its contents that a very
considerable period elapses before the difficulty in making water
becomes cognizable to the patient, or it occasions an annoyance so
trifling as scarcely to excite his attention. This increase of strength
in the bladder frequently renders the formation of stricture so
insidious that the urethra at the affected part is very narrow before
the individual is aware of the existence of any contraction whatever;
the bladder, however, at length becomes unable to empty itself, and the
abdominal muscles and diaphragm powerfully act as coadjutors, so that
each effort to make water is accompanied by a straining which is very
distressing, and the complete evacuation of the bladder is often not
accomplished even by these combined forces. The straining which
accompanies stricture, and which seems necessary to evacuate the
bladder, although it be occasionally exceedingly annoying to the patient
at the time, is more important with reference to the results which are
its consequence. I am firmly of opinion that there are a great number of
patients laboring under hernia which has been produced by no other
cause. I must confess that I had seen a great number of instances of
stricture in ruptured patients before I drew any inference from the
observation of their co-existence.&rdquo; The foregoing observations of
Macilwain, made in 1830, are here reproduced for their clearness of
expression and explanation, as well as to show what injuries can be
produced on the young child afflicted with phimosis. We are, as
surgeons, familiar with the anatomical and pathological changes there
are undergone by the bladder and its lining membrane, as well as in the
ureters and kidneys, in many <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
cases of stricture, as well as of the great amount of prostatic
irritability and enlargement that is due to the same cause. How
similarly these results can be and are actually produced by phimosis is
undeniably expressed by the post-mortem appearances in the poor infant
described by Golding Bird to the London Medical Society, and mentioned
in the London <i>Lancet</i> of May 16, 1846. The bladder and ureter were like
those of a man who had long suffered from stricture. From the remarks of
Dr. J. Lewis Smith, that phimosis may be productive of inguinal hernia
and prolapsus of the rectum, and the observations of Edmund Owens and
Arthur Kemp, both high authorities on children&rsquo;s diseases, being
both connected with children&rsquo;s hospitals, as well as the remarks
of Mr. Bryant in his &ldquo;Surgical Diseases of Children,&rdquo; who
all concur in looking upon phimosis as a great factor in hernia, Bryant
having observed thirty-one in fifty consecutive cases of phimosis, we
are certainly warranted in assuming that phimosis is not only a mere
local timely inconvenience that will disappear with the approach of
puberty, but a condition which, in the more easily affected organism of
the child,&mdash;lacking, as it does, that resistance that comes with
our prime,&mdash;is productive of serious harm; as even the first few
years of life, even a few months of infant life, with a phimosis, are
sufficient to so change the structures of parts that the poor child will
grow into a man with an impaired kidney or sacculated ureter. The strain
required to induce a prolapsus of the bowel or a rupture into the
inguinal canal is exerted as much on the bladder, ureter, and kidney as
on the other localities. Physicians who have taken the pains to observe
must have noticed, more than once, how the child afflicted with a
phimosis has not only at times to wait for the stream of urine to
appear, there seemingly being some obstruction to its starting, but how
often such a case is afflicted with a stammering, halting urination. A
child thus started out into life, with a defective kidney or kidneys, is
sadly handicapped in his usefulness, comfort, or in properly competing
in the race of life. No parent would for a moment think of starting his
son in life by giving him a business that is heavily mortgaged at the
start, but many a parent unconsciously launches the unsuspecting child
into a life of such ill health&mdash;resulting from a simple narrow
prepuce&mdash;beside which a heavy mortgage or a heavy yearly tribute
would be but a mere trifle. I have seen such men, who in after life,
broken-down and perfectly physical wrecks, would gladly have given all
their wealth and been willing to have some genii set them down in the
middle of the Sahara, shirtless and pennyless, provided they had their
health. To say nothing of the trifling loss of the prepuce, these
parties would gladly have had a foot or a leg go with the prepuce if
necessary, and have their health.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_104_104" id="Footnote_104_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_104_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> I have often performed dilatation where, for some reason,
either the timidity of the parents or the health of the child seemed to
contraindicate any more radical procedure. It is customary to advise
mothers or the nurses to retract the skin daily, but even after a good
dilatation I have found as sudden a recontraction, and even in the
majority of cases, where daily drawing back the skin might have been
practicable, the cries and struggles of the child are a positive
prohibition to these instructions being carried out; it is not once in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
ten times that it can be carried out. I have seen two very annoying
cases of paraphimosis resulting from this procedure, the struggles of
the child having prevented the return of the prepuce to its proper
place, and the violent crying and sobbing of the child having assisted
to congest the organ.</p></div>

well-established fact that nervous injuries and affections are easily
transmissible and become hereditary, how much feeble-mindedness is due
to an heredity originally induced in either parent through reflex
neuroses from the genital organs. The Jews have a very small percentage
of feeble-minded; it is true that they have not any inebriates to assist
in their manufacture, but still the absence of these well-pronounced
cases of reflex neuroses among the race must be largely ascribed to
their practice of circumcision, as that operation cures the gentiles so
afflicted.</p></div>

appropriate remedy.</p></div>

Encyclopedia of Law&rdquo; there is an interesting account of a young
child (who had been bound out by the parish officials) who murdered his
little bed-fellow and, on trial and conviction, was sentenced to be
hanged, but who was reprieved by royal favor on account of his tender
years, the sentence being changed to imprisonment for life. The little
fellow was only eight years of age. On the trial the boy said he was
driven to commit the crime because the other child soiled the bed. The
two children being both paupers, it may well be imagined that their
bedding was none of the cleanest at the best, or that their bed-room had
the best of ventilation. As at the time the murder was committed English
paupers were not treated in the most humane manner, it is not surprising
that a nervous, sensitive child would, under such a combination of
circumstances, be converted into an insane murderer.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_108_108" id="Footnote_108_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_108_108"><span class="label">[108]</span></a> The study of prematurely acquired impotence in the male
is a most interesting one. I have frequently seen it result from the
presence of anal or rectal irritation, from h&aelig;morrhoids. I have seen
cases who could not have erections, and in whom all sexual desire was
extinct at a very early age, who have informed me that, although unable
to have sexual intercourse because of the total absence of sexual
desire, the flaccidity of the organ, and the want of sound physiological
organic functional activity to suggest the thought, they had,
nevertheless, frequently been the victims of nocturnal emissions before
the <ins class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original
showed &lsquo;totel&rsquo;.">total</ins> extinction of the function. As a
rule, much of this premature impotence&mdash;induced by either irritation of
the genital organs or rectal or anal troubles&mdash;runs its unfortunate
possessor through such a course of physical incidents as described by
Hammond, as the wild Indians of the Southwest induce in the <i>mujerado</i>.
At first the sound organ responds in a natural manner to any stimulus
that may affect it, but soon a local satyriacal condition is set up,
which, running a more or less rapid period of intense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
activity, soon leaves its victim completely, permanently, and
hopelessly impotent, even as much so as if eunuchized in the most
approved manner. Hammond&rsquo;s description of the manner in which
these unfortunates are manufactured is an interesting addition to the
facts contained in the natural history of man, and is as follows:
&ldquo;A <i>mujerado</i> is an essential person in the saturnalia, or orgies,
in which these Indians, like the ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and other
nations, indulge. He is the chief passive agent in the pederastic
ceremonies which form so important a part in the performances. These
take place in the spring of every year, and are conducted with the
utmost secrecy, as regards the non-Indian part of the population. For
the making of a <i>mujerado</i> one of the most virile men is selected, and
the act of masturbation is performed upon him many times every day; at
the same time he is made to ride almost continuously on horseback. The
genital organs are thus brought, at first, into a state of extreme
erethism, so that the motion of the horse is sufficient to produce a
discharge of seminal fluid, while at the same time the pressure of the
body on the animal&rsquo;s back&mdash;for the riding is done without a
saddle&mdash;interferes with their proper nutrition. It eventually
happens that, though an orgasm may be caused, emissions can no longer be
effected, even upon the most intense degree of excitation. Finally, the
accomplishment of an orgasm becomes impossible; in the meantime the
penis and testicles begin to shrink, and in time reach their lowest
plane of degradation. But the most decided changes are at the same time
going on, little by little, in the instincts and proclivities of the
subject. He loses his taste for those sports and occupations in which he
formerly indulged, his courage disappears, and he becomes timid to such
an extent that, if he is a man occupying a prominent place in the
council of the pueblo, he is at once relieved of all power and
responsibility, and his influence is at an end. If he is married his
wife and children pass from under his control,&mdash;whether, however,
through his wish or theirs, or by the orders of the council, I could not
ascertain. They certainly become no more to him than other women and
children of the pueblo.&rdquo; Hammond examined one of these men, who
had, as he himself informed him, formerly possessed a large penis and
testicles &ldquo;grande como huevos,&rdquo;&mdash;as large as eggs. The
penis was in its flaccid state and about an inch and a half in length,
with the glans about the size of a thimble, which it very much resembled
in shape. The glandular structure of the testicles had disappeared; they
were atrophied, little besides connective tissue remaining. He examined
another <i>mujerado</i> in the pueblo of Acoma, who had been so made when at
about the age of twenty-six. The penis was not more than an inch in
length and about the diameter of the little finger, and of the testicles
there was apparently nothing left but a little connective tissue. Both
of these men had high-pitched voices. The last one examined was then
thirty-six years of age. (Hammond: &ldquo;Male Impotence.&rdquo;) The
foregoing detailed description shows an extreme degree of results
produced by an equally extreme degree of intense and persistent
irritation applied to the genital organs, purposely employed to obtain
certain results. In the cases cited the irritation or excitation is
directly applied, but it is safe to assume that reflex irritability
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
from the anus or rectum, or from that of a stricture or of a prepuce,
will in some cases produce a certain degree of excitation in the
testicles that may result in their functional or organic derangement, in
a degree proportionate to that of the amount of excitation from which
they have suffered. That the testicles are very apt to suffer from the
existence of a stricture is a well-known fact. I have myself worried
over a case of stricture, in whom the attempted passage of a filiform
bougie was always immediately followed by a severe attack of
epididymitis, and who had always been afflicted with a tenderness and a
tendency to inflammation of the testes. I have also noticed a much
greater tendency to orchitis in the wearer of an irritating prepuce than
where it was absent; so that the presence of a satyriacal tendency, no
matter in what proportion of a degree it may be present, can safely be
assumed to result in a corresponding degree of apathy, due to an actual
physical degeneration of the parts. That these conditions, when present
in any degree of permanency or persistence, will in the end induce early
impotence, I have no reason to doubt. In this regard we must not
overlook the fact that persons with phimosis, stricture, or other
genital irritants and impediments, are more liable to be afflicted with
h&aelig;morrhoids, prolapsus ani, or other anal and rectal irritation,
which retroactively assist in bringing about the condition under
question. How much this may have to do with certain prolific
peculiarities among the Jews may well be questioned; it is a well-known
fact that in London the Jewish excess of male births has been as high as
eighteen per cent., while among the Christian or Gentile population it
is only six and one-half per cent.,&mdash;a somewhat analogous condition
of proportion being also observable in the United States. Here, it is
accounted for, in a measure, by Dr. Billings, in the following words:
&ldquo;This comparatively large proportion of males among the Jews is
probably due to the fact that the death-rate of their infants is less
for males, as compared with females, than it is among the average
population.&rdquo; Children gotten during the prime of life of the
parents are naturally more virile and have better stamina than those
gotten before full maturity is reached. If the father is on the verge of
impotency just about the time he is expected to beget his best
offspring, that offspring cannot be expected to present an extra amount
of vitality, virility, or physical stamina; hence, the prepuce can be
brought in as directly tending&mdash;in no matter how small the degree
it may be, but nevertheless a factor&mdash;to the physical degeneracy of
the race, as well as it demonstrates the existence of some law for the
production of the sexes which we do not as yet fully comprehend. Aside
from the above considerations, there are those of the actual bar to the
increase of population which the prepuce induces, either by primarily
being the cause of impotence or by direct interference, as already
mentioned, and the impotence that naturally results from the causes set
forth in this note. The results of a prepuce are certainly such as must
act like a moist, warm, and oily poultice to the irritability induced in
the most confirmed Malthusian when contemplating the&mdash;to
him&mdash;rapid and unwarranted increase of population.</p></div></div>

<p class='noin'>voice. A thorough-bred person may belong to the artistic, mechanical, or
scientific classes, either appreciatively or executively; he must
exhibit both gentleness and spirit, as occasion requires; he must be
governed by the law of justice; he must make the comfort of his
associates his concern, and do what is <i>right</i> in order to enhance their
happiness.</p>

<p>The facial indications of those who are not thorough-bred, speaking
physiologically, are as follow: A coarse, thick skin; a
&ldquo;muddy&rdquo; complexion, or one permanently blotched, pimpled, or
discolored; dull eyes, very small or very large and bulging; coarse
hair, or that which is very light or colorless,&mdash;that is to say, of
no <i>decided</i> hue. I regard very light colored, pallid people as morbid
varieties; also those with irregular teeth, a very small or ill-shapen
nose, small nostrils, perpendicular jaws, exposed gums, open mouth,
receding chin, or one that projects greatly forward, ending in a point;
thin, pallid, dry lips; hollow cheeks, flat upper cheeks. ugly or
ill-shapen ears, a voice weak, thin, hoarse, shrill or nasal; a long,

<p>The undue development of certain organs and systems of the body induces
abnormal conditions, as, for example, an excessive disposition of fatty
tissue. When the appetite is voracious, or the nutritive system
uncommonly active, too much of the carbonaceous elements of the food are
eliminated, or, as it often occurs, too much carbonaceous food, such as
white bread, potatoes, etc., is consumed for the needs of the body; the
consequence is an excess of fat, which, in many subjects, impedes
respiration, prevents activity, and gives a generally uncomfortable
feeling. For this condition a spare diet is often prescribed, but as
this is felt to be a hardship, and as few who attempt it succeed in
continuing it long enough to produce satisfactory results, it is
pronounced a failure.</p>

<p>For this class of people there is a very agreeable and sure method of
reducing the bulk without reducing strength and without compelling too
great a sacrifice of the appetite.</p>

<p>A diet which will attain this result is easily obtained, and of it the
subject can use a quantity sufficient to allay the craving for food.</p>

<p>This diet consists of absolutely <i>raw</i> foods, nothing cooked being
allowed. This diet, of course, must consist mainly of fruits, nuts,
grains, milk, and, when flesh-meat is desired, a Hamburg beefsteak may
be partaken of; this steak is raw beef chopped fine and seasoned with
onion, salt, pepper, or other condiments; to this may be added raw
oysters and clams. Every kind of fruit</p>

<p class='noin c sc'>Fig. 300&mdash;EDWARD JENNER, M.D. (Celebrated English Physician,
Author, and Discoverer of Vaccination.)</p>

<p>No scientific physiognomist could mistake this face for other than that
of a physician, and an earnest and attentive one as well, as evidenced
by the signs of &ldquo;natural physician&rdquo; in the cheek-bones, in
the attitude of the head and neck, and by the thoughtful, observant
expression of the eye. The combination of systems in this subject is
such as is most frequently observed among physicians, viz., the
supremacy of the osseous and brain systems. The muscular, thoracic, and
vegetative powers all assist in this combination by their development.
The signs for Conscience and Firmness are apparent. Love of Home and
Patriotism rank high. Benevolence, Amativeness, Love of Young, Mirth,
Approbation, Self-esteem, Modesty, Friendship, Alimentiveness,
Sanativeness, Pneumativeness, and Color combine to form a lovely
domestic and social nature. The form, size, and peculiarities of the
nose claim attention. It is a nose denoting Constructiveness,
Originality, and logical power. The signs for Hope, Analysis, Mental
Imitation, Human Nature, Ideality, Sublimity, Construction, and
Acquisition are strongly delineated. Self-will is normally developed,
while Size, Form, Observation, Weight, Locality, Calculation, and Memory
of various sorts are manifest. The signs of Language in the eye and
mouth denote fluency, while the practical faculties, being dominant,
would give clearness, perspicacity, and directness to his style of
expression, either oral or written. Time, Order, Reason, and Intuition
are well developed. The long-continued observation and experiments of
this noble physician in his endeavor to protect humanity from the
ravages of small-pox by his discovery of vaccination, met at last with a
suitable recognition, for he received by a vote of Parliament the sum of
&pound;30,000, and special honors were awarded him. It is a singular
fact that all of the benefactors of the human race&mdash;those who have
benefited it by discoveries of any kind whatever&mdash;have met with the
most violent opposition, treachery, and often disgrace, before they
could make the world see the value of their discoveries. Such was the
case with Dr. Jenner, but his firmness and truth at last gained the
victory.</p></div>

<p>The best <i>form</i> for a surgeon who attempts the most severe
operations is the round build of body and head, and many of them
are of this shape. The muscular system should be supreme, with
the brain system a close second, the bony and thoracic systems
about equal and next in development.</p>

<p>The muscular tissue is <i>comparatively unfeeling</i>&mdash;insensitive;</p>

<p class='noin'>in the body. Form and Size are also requisite to aid the memory of the
shape and relative position of each part, and to assist Locality. Human
Nature is essential in order that he may be <i>en rapport</i> with his
patients, and also to enable him to <i>divine</i> instinctively all bodily
and mental states. He should be a good physiognomist, and be well versed
in the <i>pathology</i> of physiognomy. He must have large Observation, in
order to take cognizance of the most minute changes and appearances.
Calculation is a useful trait also, as it is required in many ways in
the medication and treatment of the wounded, as in chemistry and in
making surgical implements, etc. He should have large Friendship; in
order to attach his patients to him and to command their esteem; enough
Benevolence to sympathize, but not enough to weaken the feelings when
severity is required. The faculty of Amativeness is necessary to
<i>comprehend</i> the nature of the opposite sex; Love of Young also, that he
may inspire children with love and confidence.</p>

<p>The sense of Weight should be a strong one, for the muscular sense is
dependent upon its power in order to <i>gauge</i> the amount of force to be
used in handling instruments and in bandaging wounds, limbs, etc.
Executiveness is required to assist authority and give resistance.
Self-will is another ally most necessary, as well as Analysis, Time,
Order, and Reason. A fair share of musical ability is required to assist
the ear in making examinations of the heart and lungs, and in
auscultation for various other purposes. If to these faculties one adds
large Intuition, he has a fine bodily and mental equipment for the
practice of surgery.</p>

<p class='sc lc mt1 noin c'>OTHER CLASSES OF SURGEONS.</p>

<p>Many army surgeons are characterized by a round and broad form, with
broad, rather low, and round heads; short, round arms, and round and
tapering fingers. This build is the most suitable for those severe
operations which require the greatest exhibition of force, endurance,
and coolness; another class of surgeons&mdash;those who undertake the
more delicate and less forceful operations&mdash;are characterized by
about an equal development of the brain and muscular systems. This class
of surgeons tend naturally to the treatment of those finer, less
difficult, and more delicate cases of operative surgery, such, for
example, as treatment of the ear, the eye, etc. This class of surgeons
require a fine endowment of the brain and nervous system. In short, the
muscles as well as nerves of this class must be sensitive to a great
degree, and this combination calls for a fine and high organization.</p>

<p>The surgeon should be something of an actor in order to know when to be
sympathetic and when to be severe. Yet he</p>
